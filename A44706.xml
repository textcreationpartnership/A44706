            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader, with ſome Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the Authors Epiſtle.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He infirmity of crowding to the Preſſe is growne Epidemicall. Infirmity I call it; becauſe from thence men doe <hi>(Publicè inſanire)</hi> and have this unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that, in the Apoſtles phraſe, their madneſſe is knowne to all men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 9. And Epidemicall I call it: for who though of the meaneſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but may fill his hand and the Preſſe at pleaſure. Such hath been the Licenſe of theſe latter times, that Pamphlets ſwarme without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and now the pretended Mother ſtriveth to divide the childe, with the true, errour with truth, and pleadeth if it hath not equall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Preſſe, that truth is ſuppreſt. We want ſome wiſe <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to give wiſe judgement, to give truth its owne, and let errour know what ſhe is. Whether the want of ſuch hath not much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Preſſe, blemiſhed the truth, impeded Reformation, diſſetled the people, let common experience determine. Such daily births of Pamphlets to and fro can be no leſſe to the people, then the windes are to the waves, make them crowde into new ſtormes. As Athens aſcribed her troubles to the Orators, who toſſed the flexible multitude into ſedition; I wiſh that this had not too great an influence into our preſent diſtractions; which if they were ſuch as did recompence us with ſome hidden truths, they were worth the buying at ſo deare a rate; but if we obſerve them, they are ſuch as are addicted only to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call truth, as if they were hired to curſe Iſrael. If they can but call Antichriſtian, erroneous, impious, blaſphemous, it paſſeth for current, as if they had proved it ſo, as if a foule mouth was the Index of a deep head, and ſcurrilitie the meaſure of reaſon.</p>
            <p>Reader, that which thou haſt here to the teſt, and examined, is no new opinion, nor any new light added to an old truth, but the manner
<pb facs="tcp:45603:3"/> of maintaining it is very ſingular, none before daring to appeare ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in Print.</p>
            <p>This with foure other annexed points of <hi>Arminius,</hi> have formerly troubled quiet ſtates and ſtrong heads, but now I cannot ſay that they doe either: Men of but indifferent parts (much more of more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) have left raking in the aſhes of theſe perplexed Diſputes, being ſuch as have had their heat pretty well allayed long ſince; but of late ſome indigeſted and ſhattered braines have revived them, with no more hope of ſucceſſe, than intention to cure our Commotions.</p>
            <p>The Authour of this Diſcourſe, with whom I am to engage, would be taken for a Meſſenger of new Light, but he appeares under no other face than of a miſhapen Arminian: One ſtrong in the Point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but looketh with another face in the Point of Election. In the former he is not different, but where he is more abſurd.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge the depth of theſe Controverſies, theſe nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating and criticall times, my ſlender yeares, and my Paſtorall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doe all comply to a diſadvantage, were they not counterpoiſed with ſome incouragement from my Adverſary. My genius was never martiall'd up in theſe Bible-battels, therefore it cannot be expected that I ſhould adde any new Light to theſe Points, which have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, yea exhauſted the choiſeſt Lamps in Chriſtendome for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. I muſt ſay of this my Anſwer as the Poet of his Satyr againſt ſome Scriblers in his time:
<q>
                  <note place="margin">Perſ. in Prol</note>Non ad poeſin ingenio natus, ſed temporum ratione ductus—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </q> Such are the diſtempers of the times, and the negotiations of men, both of weake judgements, and corrupt minds, that now the exigence both of truth and peace requireth, that they that have but little, caſt in their Mite. I may doe it at as cheape a rate as any. Empty Margents, common reſolutions, and an anſwer as worthleſſe as his Diſcourſe, will not be to my diſparagement. I have nothing that can promiſe more: for as I have nothing to ſatisfie if men expect, ſo I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to loſe if men cenſure.</p>
            <p>Reader, if thou obſerveſt, we may ſee the whole Fabrick in his Frontiſpiece, the marrow of his whole diſcourſe in his Epiſtle; and therein we have a taſt of that Scripture, reaſon, or faire dealing we are likely to expect from the whole, which if I ſhould throughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, and give a ſolicitous anſwer to, I ſhould prevent my ſelfe, and make my Epiſtle as voluminous as his Treatiſe: I ſhall therefore take ſome things that are not elſe where, and leave the reſt to fall under
<pb facs="tcp:45603:3"/> the ſucceſſive refutations in the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt we find the man in a paſſion of the heart:</p>
            <p>[Heartily grieved that a Church profeſsing the great love of God, in the authoriſed Doctrine thereof, ſhould be abuſed by many.] It ſeemeth then there is a Church of England, and the Doctrine thereof Orthodox, both which is much queſtioned now in theſe times; were he well furniſhed, he ſhould have my voice to be the Churches Champion, but that I feare he hath an eye more to his owne tenent then the Authority of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo long as She ſaith as he ſaith, Shee ſhall not want the Title of a Church, that it may bee known he hath the ſuffrage of a Church of his ſide: not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that Papall Sycophant, <hi>Conſtat ſummum Pontificem à pio Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino Deum appellari.</hi> But the Particulars of his ſad Complaint are theſe:</p>
            <p>[Many deny and blaſpheme this great love of God to mankind in Scripture affirmed. <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. As if God hated moſt men from Eternity, ſo as they are not beholding to him for any good at all nor have any doore of repentance, or meanes of life opened and afforded to them.] It is uſuall with Impoſtures, to frame to themſelves Adverſaries, and worke them to their owne conceits; and this is the Authour guilty of. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot produce any that denyeth the great love of God to the world of mankind: <hi>John</hi> 3.16. Which is, that he ſent his Son, that thoſe that beleeve might not periſh, but have everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. 2. For his deduction there-from, it is no high blaſphemy to deny.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As for that Phraſe, [Hating moſt men from Eternitie.] He doth not deale very candidly, to ſet before his Reader the odious tearme of (Hating moſt men from Eternity,) which fleſh and bloud doth not well digeſt, without explaining the meaning of his Adverſaries herein, as if they taught ſome monſtrus
<pb facs="tcp:45603:4"/> Doctrine, when indeed it is his owne Doctrine. For, that God hated <hi>Eſau</hi> he cannot deny, and that that hatred conſiſted in his denying that peculiar favour to <hi>Eſau</hi> which he gave to <hi>Jacob,</hi> he granteth; <hi>Pag.</hi> 93. And ſo he defineth Gods hatred to be a leſſe loving; <hi>Pag.</hi> 92, And this leſſe loving is a denying of that good which he giveth to another. Now, for God to deny that great good, <hi>viz.</hi> Grace and Glory, to moſt men, which hee giveth to his Elect, this is in our ſenſe to hate them; and let him if he can produce any that ſpeaks otherwiſe of Gods hatred: But this is no ſuch Blaſphemy as he pretendeth, for he ſaith no leſſe himſelfe: [He decreed to harden and give up the reſidue, for contempt of meanes, to ſhew his juſtice, when he overcommeth his Elect, and brings them in to beleeve, and ſo to the inheritance. <hi>Pag.</hi> 123.] Now, is not to decree to harden, to deny that great good, Grace and Glory, which he giveth to his Elect in overcoming them to beleeve? And is not this to hate? And is not this to moſt men in his owne expreſſes? Yet he cries out of blaſpheming the love of God, in ſaying that in that ſenſe God is ſaid to hate moſt men. But he may happily reply, that Gods hardening moſt men is for contempt of meanes; but this helpeth him not, becauſe he overcommeth his Elect notwithſtanding contempt of meanes; therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that grace to one which he giveth to another:<note place="margin">Aquin. part. <hi>1.</hi> q. <hi>23.</hi> art. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> Therefore to this I ſay with <hi>Aquinas: [In quantum vult. omnibus aliquod bonum, omnes amat; in quantum aliquibus non dat quodcunque bonum, nec illud bonum quod eſt vita aeterna, ideo eos odio habet &amp; reprobat.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, As for that Phraſe of [Moſt men being not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to God for any good at all.] It is his owne perverſe inference; that becauſe we ſay he denyeth the top of his love to moſt men, therefore he chargeth us with this, that they are not beholding to God for any good. Falſe ſuggeſtion! That God ſhineth both on Juſt and unjuſt, ſhews many mercies to all, no man denyeth: <hi>[Omnibus dat aliquod bonum, ideo omnes amat.]</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:45603:4"/>
            <p>Fourthly, As for the laſt, [And no doore of life and repentance ſet open for them.] I only demand, what doore can be ſet open? and with what intention it is ſet open to them whom God hath determined to give up to deſtruction? But this he hath done to moſt men, as he ſaith, <hi>Pag.</hi> 120. Now that I may in a few words thus reaſon: they that are decreed to be given up and hardened are Reprobated, and they that are Reprobated, whilſt they remaine ſo, cannot be ſaved, nor receive Faith, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is the Confeſſion of <hi>Corvinus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. §. 5</note> 
               <hi>[Si intelligatur de reprobo qua tali in ſenſu compoſito, nego reprobum poſſe ſalvari aut fidem accipere &amp; ſe convertere.]</hi> And that they that are from Eternity Reprobated, do alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſo, is cleare from their Principles: becauſe Reprobation is paſt on them that do finally perſiſt in Infidelity and diſobedience, whom God foreſeeth to do ſo, and by vertue of his preſcience do infallibly perſiſt in it, and ſo remaine alwaies Reprobates. Hence is it that <hi>Corvinus</hi> himſelfe,<note place="margin">

Therefore how a doore of life can be opened to ſuch in time I cannot ſee, and to deny it is no blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which he ſadly layeth to heart is: That</p>
            <p>[Many contradict plaine ſayings of Scripture, as that Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome for all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. Chriſt taſted death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. and affirme contrarie, that Chriſt did not ſhed his bloud, or die for everie man.</p>
            <p>But herein he diſcovers either affected Ignorance, or wilfull Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot produce any that deny the truth of thoſe Scriptures. If he will content himſelfe with what thoſe places affirme he ſhall have no Antagoniſt: but that which we deny is his gloſſes on, and inferences from thoſe Texts, as that Chriſt did by death procure
<pb facs="tcp:45603:5"/> Eternall life for every ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> which no Scripture affirmeth. The Remonſt. to whom our Author muſt come behind in theſe Controverſies, have been ſo farre from charging us with denying Plaine ſayings of Scriptures, that they have granted that their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is not, nor can be thought to be contained in plaine ſayings of Scripture.<note place="margin">Col. Hagien <hi>170.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>[Vrgent fratres articulum iſtum totidem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Scripturae nunqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reperiri; ſed reſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demus, fierinon poſſe ut articulus Controverſus inter eos qui Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram pro verbo Dei agnoſcunt totidem verbis Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae concipiatur.]</hi> They had the ingenuity to conceive that no man that had the leaſt ſparke of grace, or reaſon, would queſtion or deny that which the Scripture plainely affirmeth;<note place="margin">Rep. ad art. <hi>31.</hi> art. <hi>12</hi>

            <p>A third thing that he complaineth of is this:</p>
            <p>[That the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be called a flat lie, (<hi>viz.</hi> that God redeemed me and all mankind) in this aſſertion, he redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med none but the Elect.] Wherein we may ſee the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath a Son of a very good nature, but a very bad ingeny, ſorry to have her wronged, but knoweth not when ſhe is ſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pickes quarrels without cauſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that takes the Liturgie of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for the Doctrine thereof may very well take that for an injury which is not; and what cauſe many have had to ſay, that many expreſſions were foiſted into the Liturgie, and it not retaine its Primitive puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I leave to him to examine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To redeem <hi>totum genus humanum,</hi> is no more then <hi>Omnia ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera hominum:</hi> all mankind, no more then all the kinds of men: and if he would have that Phraſe to meane further, he muſt prove it: now this is not proved a lye by ſaying he redeemed only the Elect, for ſuch he hath in all kinds of men</p>
            <p n="3">3. If he peruſe the Doctrine of <hi>England</hi> in the 39. Articles, he
<pb facs="tcp:45603:5"/> ſhall ſee contrary to his Doctrine; unleſſe to the words thereof he adde his corrupt Comments.</p>
            <p>A fourth thing which he grieveth for, is this:</p>
            <p>[That men ſhould run into ſo many long-ago-condemned practiſes, evill and Papiſticall, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their Contradictions of the truth.] But his practice of ſo prepoſſeſſing the minds of his Reader without ground, is far more Jeſuiticall: and was he of any authority [with any but them that labour with his Ignorance] So that we might ſay his tongue is a ſlander, we might upon better ground be grieved for his Calumny: But thoſe tricks where with he challengeth us I ſhall examine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. [Pretending inſufficiencie in the Scripture to be the Determiner of matters of faith] This is but his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forgery, and Calumny, he cannot ſhew wherein we pretend ſo much, or at leaſt it muſt be in that wherein he is as guilty as any. It hath been our plea that no Scripture holdeth forth his Doctrine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is no need why we ſhould fly to the inſufficiency of Scripture to determine matters of faith; indeed his gloſſes and Comments we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer to determine our faith, therefore let that ſhift be returned to them that need it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. [Pretending darkeneſſe in Fundamentalls] But herein I demand, whether any there be that ſaith in expreſſe words, that the Scripture is darke in Fundamentals, or whether it be a deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own from our expreſſes upon ſome places of Scripture; if the firſt, then I expect that he produce them; If the ſecond, I doubt it will appeare that the Jeſuiticall Sophiſtry hath a greater influence into his practice then ours: Juſt ſuch dealing as we have from them, we have from him, and in both moſt unjuſt forgeries. The Papiſts becauſe they cannot worke us to their mind to ſay that all Scriptures are hard, they to make us odious traduce us, as if we held that all Scriptures are eaſie. So the Rhemiſts object againſt us in theſe words:<note place="margin">Rhem. Teſt. in preſ. §. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> [They find no difficultie in the Booke ſealed with Seven Seales, and no Interpreter with the Eunuch.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gag.</hi> for new Goſp. <hi>Pag.</hi> 1.</note>] And in another Treatiſe this is laid down by them as an Error of the Proteſtants; [That they
<pb facs="tcp:45603:6"/> maintaine that the Scriptures are eaſie.] And now the Author ſaith as a charge againſt us, that we hold that the Scripture is darke in Fundamentals; delivering it ſo lurgely, and ſo indefinitely, as if we held that the Scripture was wholly darke in Fundamentals; but if either of theſe Calumniators had but conſidered that ſome Scriptures are eaſie, ſome hard and difficult, Scripture neither wholy darke, nor wholly eaſie, there might have been little cauſe appearing for ſuch a Calumny on either ſide. Now to this Allegation, if he meane that the Scripture every where treating of the Foundation, is darke, this no man ſaith: If he meane that in ſome things that are concerning the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Scripture is darke and obſcure, he cannot upon good ground deny it; certainly St <hi>Peter</hi> was of that mind when he ſaid, many things were ſo hard to be underſtood, that the unlearned did wreſt them to their deſtruction, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>But beſides, it is no convincing Argument againſt us becauſe we do as the Papiſts, if either the Authour or <hi>Arminius</hi> be right; our Author in the 118. <hi>Pag.</hi> is loth to diſlike all that they ſay, and <hi>Arminius</hi> being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with holding a Papiſticall Tenent,<note place="margin">In Perkins, <hi>258.</hi>
               </note> thus replyed; <hi>Anne quia Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificia ideo falſa?</hi> This may be eaſily wiped off if he could produce any that did ſo ſay.</p>
            <p n="4">4. [Vſing carnall reaſons to frame abſurdities that follow.] It ſeemes, that reaſoning that preſſeth his Tenent with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, is carnall reaſoning: a ſafe concluſion for himſelfe, he would faine embrace the errour, but not meddle with the abſurdities that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; true it is that <hi>[Ab uno abſurdo mille ſequuntur.]</hi> Many abſurdities will follow from an abſurditie, but certainly no abſurdity will follow from the truth. If his Tenent be Truth, he need not feare to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the abſurdities that follow; but in that he feares the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, it is a ſtrong ſuſpition that it is not truth which yet he would embrace, but leave the other, as the Cat, <hi>[Amat piſcem ſed non vult tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere Lympham.]</hi> But beſides, it is neither a Papiſticall ſhift, nor carnall reaſoning to refute errour by abſurdities that follow, it was the Apoſtles practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. He proveth the Reſurrection by thoſe abſurdities that follow upon the deniall of it: as then is not Chriſt riſen, then are we of all Creatures moſt miſerable, elſe why are ye baptized for the dead, and many other in that Chapter; and very frequent is this way of Confutation in Scripture; and it is a very pregnant way of arguing; but he diſcovereth plainly what thoughts he hath of his Tenent, when he
<pb facs="tcp:45603:6"/> is loath to be troubled with the abſurdities that follow, and I blame him not, for they are many and great.</p>
            <p n="4">4. [Impoſing ſtrange ſenſes of plaine ſayings of Scripture.] But what theſe ſtrange ſenſes are he ſhould have done well to have inſerted, that the Reader might have had a ſurvey of them, but in that he chargeth us without inſtance, I need not anſwer: But this I dare referre to any intelligent Reader that is but verſed in the leaſt meaſure, to judge whether they that hold his Tenent, or we, give the ſtrangeſt and moſt exoticke interpretations, and they that do, let them lye under that blacke Charge. Let any review thoſe ſtrange ſenſes that the Remonſt. put upon <hi>John</hi> 6.37.44. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. With all others that give any light in theſe Controverſies, of which our Author favours in his whole Treatiſe: as in <hi>Pag.</hi> That Text <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>[Thoſe that my Father giveth me ſhall come unto me.]</hi> By thoſe that are (given to Chriſt) he interprets, thoſe that are given to him in the heavenly Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſo as to come to him; So that this firſt (giving) taketh in comming to him; and the ſenſe is this, thoſe that come unto me ſhall come unto me, thoſe that beleeve ſhall beleeve; this in the eyes of any reaſonable man cannot but ſeeme a ſtrange Interpretation. So that Text, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>[No man can come except my Father draw him.]</hi> By drawing here, the Remonſt. as alſo the Author, <hi>Pag.</hi> Meane the drawing by the call of the Goſpell, outward only by Morall ſuaſion, and ſuch a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as is diſtinct from bringing them in to beleeve and give themſelves to Chriſt: But any that conſiders the Context, may adjudge this a ſtrange Interpretation. Our Saviour being to ſhew a reaſon why among thoſe that did equally enjoy the outward call of the Goſpel, and ſo as that they were convinced, yet ſome did not beleeve, he giveth this as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>No man can come unto me except my Father draw him.</hi> Now this word (drawing) ſhewing a reaſon of a diſparity in condition, cannot be meant of that wherein there was a parity amongſt them. So for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; but the enſuing Diſcourſe will furniſh any with ability to judge who is moſt guilty of ſtrange Senſes, and Interpretations of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Having thus ended his ſad complaint, he cometh to counſel his reader, or if he pleaſe, to be an anſwerer, wherein lyeth a mixture of egregious Slanders, therefore I ſhall touch them a little: he wiſheth his Antagoniſt,</p>
            <p>[Not to invent lies and ſlanders, to make infamous
<pb facs="tcp:45603:7"/> Such as will not be of the ſame opinion, in which the Antichriſtian brood aboundeth; and ſo many have done in this buſineſſe alſo, giving it out to others, that ſuch as ſay that Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.42. gave himſelfe a ranſome for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. that theſe are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. [Falſe witneſſes againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles.] I ſhould expect the ſame dealing from him to us, that he expects from us to him; and in teaching us to beware of lies and ſlanders, he ſhould not become the father of a lye and ſlander himſelfe: It is not my language, but his owne retorted. I know none more guilty of it than himſelfe: For herein he would poſſeſſe his Reader, that we ſay thoſe that ſay as <hi>John</hi> 4.42. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. Such are falſe witneſſes againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles. A ſhamefull forgery, that beareth its ſhame in the face of it, no man being ſo ſenſeleſſe to charge any man for a falſe witneſſe againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles for ſaying as they ſay. Let the Author remind his owne Tract, and tell me is there nothing there but what Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpeake? To inſtance, when he ſpeaketh of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. He ſaith that that place ſaith that Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome for all Adams Sons, and thoſe that have a being from him: <hi>Pag.</hi> 55.57. Yea, every individuall of all mankind: <hi>Pag.</hi> 61. But I pray doth Chriſt or his Apoſtles ſay ſo? I could never yet ſee it; no, it is a ſenſe that he putteh upon that Text; and ſo doing, if any ſay he is a falſe witneſſe againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles, he is not to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of ſlander: rather the ſlander is the Authours charge, becauſe when we deny his interpretation, he ſaith we deny the words; and when any ſaith he is a falſe witneſſe againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles for obtruding ſuch a ſenſe on them as they will not owne, he chargeth us with ſlander, as if we ſaid he was a falſe witneſſe that ſayth as thoſe places ſay: He might have remembred that ſaying, <hi>Qui alterum accuſat probri,</hi> &amp;c. He that accuſeth another, had need looke home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. [That ſuch are Arminians.] How ready he is to embrace the Tenent, yet ſhie of entertaining the name of <hi>Arminius?</hi> for him or any that holds the univerſality of merit of Chriſts death, to account it
<pb facs="tcp:45603:7"/> a ſlander to be called an <hi>Arminian,</hi> is a meere foppery, and for me to give a ſerious anſwer herein, would be to be guilty of his folly. The Doctrine it ſelfe is one of the five points of <hi>Arminius,</hi> the diſtinction of procuring and applying, which the Author uſeth, and the manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it is theirs, the Scriptures produced by our Author in purſuance of it are produced by them, his interpretations of contrary Texts are theirs, his Anſwers to our Arguments are theirs; if I make not all this good, I ſhall willingly lye downe under that cenſure. And if the caſe be thus, it is not our ſlander but his folly that appeareth. For either he hath read <hi>Arminius</hi> or not; if he hath not, then his want of ingenuity appeares in charging us with ſlander, in ſaying he is an Arminian, when he knoweth not what an Arminian is: If he have, then his diſhoneſty appeareth in ſo ſhamefully denying his Maſter, when he cannot but know, his ſpeech doth ſo bewray him. Indeed <hi>Arminius</hi> hath had an ill ſavour amongſt us for theſe late yeares, and that he reſenteth, therefore I cannot blame him if he be not willing to be ſeene under that garbe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. [That ſuch hold that Chriſt dyed for all men alike.] If this be ſuch a ſlander, I would he would not afford ſuch a faire occaſion for our preſuming in this caſe. Doth not his whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſavour ſtrongly of it? Let him ſhew me where in all his Booke he maketh the Death of Chriſt to make any difference. Let us but take a taſt: He treating of the ends of his Death, layeth downe three: Firſt, To ſatisfie Juſtice. Secondly, To become their Lord. Thirdly, To ranſome from the Curſe. Now if in any place of his Booke he maketh it appeare, that he ſatisfied the juſtice of God for one more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or became their Lord over one more than another; or did ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome one more than another, then I ſhall thinke that he holdeth not that Chriſt dyed for all men alike; indeed I thinke he maketh the application to be with a difference, but for the impetration or purchaſe, I ſuppoſe he maketh it to be generall, and equall: but if he do not hold ſo, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be the ſame betwixt him and his Antagoniſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. [That men by nature have free will to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, that there is no Election, that there is no Grace but what men may fall from.] This I conceive ſome men lay to his charge, and the ground is this: No abſolute Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, univerſall Attonement, free will, falling away from Grace, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed Points, and hitherto have been inſeparable, and thoſe that have
<pb facs="tcp:45603:8"/> maintained the one, have with equall ſtrength maintained the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when hee doth ſo well acquit himſelfe in the one as quite to deſert the other, I ſhall confeſſe my ſelfe deceived in this buſineſſe. Indeed, he granteth abſolute Election, not upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of faith, but then this deſtroyeth generall Attonement, as I ſhew in the following Diſcourſe; Therefore he muſt come to deny abſolute Election, or elſe relinquiſh generall Attonement. And ſo for the reſt, they are ſo naturall to his expreſſes in his Diſcourſe, that it will be a hard thing to quit himſelfe of them, how ever the following Diſcourſe will put him to his Purgators, and I feare at laſt they will appeare no ſlanders. I would he did not give too faire occaſion for to charge him. I ſhall mind the Reader but of one thing more, and that is the pretence of the Author, of a tye that lyeth upon him to maintain this Doctrin, and that is the Proteſtation which he took [to defend the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt Popery, and Popiſh Innovations, which the Tenent of Chriſt not dying for all, opens a wide doore unto.] Hereby we may ſee with what ſiniſter reſpects he was byaſſed, and with what blind zeale he was acted when he tooke the Proteſtation; his concluding that he was thereby engaged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend univerſall redemption, is a bad preſident for Popiſh mentall reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and the enervation of all Covenants, if they may be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conceit of the Takers, for there is nothing to which we are leſſe engaged than to that: But he here magnifieth his peircing judgement in deſcrying that tye that few beſides himſelfe could ſee, but his ground I ſhall examine, (becauſe happily it may reflect on them that are of a contrary judgement, yet are under the ſame Covenant with him.) His grounds are twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. [He profeſſed to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and Popiſh Innovations:] To which he thinkes the denyall of his Doctrine ſets a wide doore open. I know not what his conſcience is, I am ſure his underſtanding is weake if he herein ſpeake as he thinks; as for any feare of Popery I conceive no ground, there is no affinity at all: Let the Author peruſe the Jeſuites over, looke the Remiſts in the Controverted places, and then let him tell me if that Proteſtation tyed him againſt Popery, obliged him to hold univerſall Redemption; the Authour (if he tooke the Proteſtation in judgement) doth, or may
<pb facs="tcp:45603:8"/> know, that Papiſts are divided in thoſe Points as well as Proteſtants: and that ours hath no more affinity with Popery than his Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Papiſts there are on both ſides, as well as Proteſtants on both ſides.</p>
            <p n="2">2. [The ſecond ground is, becauſe he proteſted to defend the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>] As if his Doctrine fetched any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from that: He produceth foure ſeverall Articles, I ſhall examine them ſeverally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. [<hi>Art.</hi> 6. Holy Scripture containeth all things neceſſary to ſalvation, ſo that what is not there read, or proved by it, is not required of any to be beleeved] True: But why doth not he thinke himſelfe by this obliged rather to relinquiſh his opinion than to defend it? Seeing no Scripture ſpeaketh ſo much, as is afterwards ſhewne; and in that no Scripture faith ſo much, this Article of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> binds him not to beleeve it, much leſſe to defend it: Firſt let him prove that his Tenent is the language of Scripture before he be bound by that article to defend it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. [<hi>Art.</hi> 20. It is not lawfull for the Church to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine any thing that is contrary to the Word of God, neither may it ſo expound one place of Scripture that it be ſo repugnant to another.] And ſtill this is no friend to him or his Doctrine, or way of maintaining it; it muſt be firſt tryed who are moſt guilty of giving ſuch uncouth interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as that they cannot be reconciled to other places, which I feare will fall upon the Author, and this the enſuing Diſcourſe will make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Herein the Reader may take a ſurvey of the ſize of the Authors underſtanding and judgement in his Proteſtation taking.</p>
            <p n="3">3. [<hi>Art.</hi> 2. Chriſt very God, very man, who ſuffered, was crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a Sacrifice not only for originall guilt, but alſo for all actuall ſins of men.] This is truth, but then the Reader may ſee that is no ſuch enemy to the Popiſh Innovation, againſt which this Article was framed; nor is this Article ſo great a friend to his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as he in both pretendeth: Let us take the Popiſh Innovation as he
<pb facs="tcp:45603:9"/> layeth it downe, <hi>Pag.</hi> 98. [That Chriſt only paid the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the debt to his Father, wholly in reſpect of Eternall puniſhment, and left a Part of the debt in reſpect of temporall puniſhments for his People to pay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Now, whether do we that ſay according to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that Chriſt by his death was a Sacrifice not for originall only, nor ſome actuall ſins only, but originall and all actuall ſins of them for whom he dyed, So that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here is no new debt required of them for which he did not ſatisfie; or, he that ſaith that there is a new debt which Chriſt did not ſatisfie for, <hi>viz.</hi> Contempt of meanes of grace, which God may require of them for whom Chriſt dyed, as a debt not ſatisfied for, let any rationall man judge. But as the grounds of his proteſting, So are his performances, very weake. Secondly, This Article is no friend to his Tenent; for, if he have not ſuffered ſhipwracke of his common underſtanding, he may ſee a wide difference betwixt the ſins of all men, and all the ſins of men, and hence ariſeth his miſtake, he referreth the Particle (All) to men, and it is to be referred to ſins. That Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſaith he hath wrought a cure on all the members of mans body, doth no way inferre that he hath wrought a cure of the Members of all mens bodies. That Article tendeth hitherto, to affirme that Chriſt did take away all the ſins of them for whom he dyed, as well Actuall as Originall, and our Authour would ſtretch it to averre that he tooke away the Actuall and Originall ſins of every man: but this is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, but to deſtroy the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. [<hi>Art.</hi> 15.31. That by the Sacrifice of himſelfe he ſhould take away the ſins of the world, and all the ſins of the whole world both Originall and Actuall, and this againſt a Popiſh Innovation] Truth; and ſo he doth take away the ſin of the world, that is of men living in the world: as he is ſaid to be beleeved on in the world, that is, by men living in the world. He taketh away ſins from the world <hi>(quoad partem creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem)</hi> in them that beleeve: as <hi>John</hi> 3.16. And for all the ſins of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all over the whole world; thus farre we grant it, but he cannot with any ſhew of reaſon ſtretch thoſe Articles any further, he may ſee that the ſcope of them tend to another buſineſſe, for if they ſhould ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:45603:9"/> as much as the Author intendeth, they ſhould ſay thus much, That Chriſt took away all Originall &amp; all Actuall ſins of every Son of <hi>Adam;</hi> which no Scripture ſpeaketh, no Arminian affirmeth, and the Author diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, for he ſaith, contempt of meanes is a new debt: Therefore the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> being Orthodox, and ſo he have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proteſted to defend it, it cannot ſpeake any ſuch thing, or any waies favour his Doctrine. Many more particulars might be inſtanced in, but they are of ſo low a flight that they cannot but be diſtaſtefull to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of them that are any way ingenuous, therefore with theſe I content my ſelfe, as affording a ſufficient taſte of his forged Calumnies, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Allegations, abuſe and foule dealing with his Oppoſers, infirm and weake grounds both in maintaining his Doctrine, and matters of greater concernment, his Covenant and Proteſtations, which ſhould be done in judgement. <hi>Ex pede Herculem,</hi> by the foot we may gueſſe at the ſtature of the Body, ſo by this we may gueſſe at the whole; but I prepoſſeſſe thee not with prejudice, as thou findeſt, judge. Now happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou mayeſt demand, why this comes forth as a birth out of due time, after ſo many in theſe Controverſies, as Mr <hi>Whitfield</hi> and others? To this I anſwer, Firſt, becauſe this was finiſhed before Mr <hi>Whitfield's</hi> came to light.

                  <hi>[Nullus omnino hominum eſt cujus falutem non velit.]</hi> And that he dyed to procure life for none, but upon this condition of ſaith, is evident from them, In that they ſay, that Chriſt may have the end of his death entire, though none either beleeve or be ſaved; and this they ſay, <hi>[Quare etſi nemo credidiſſet futurum tamen fuiſſe ut finis mortis Chriſti conſtaret, omnino credimus;]</hi> and alſo, <hi>[Cum man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti Deo reſiſtere poſſunt omnes &amp; ſinguli, relinquitur profectò, fieri poſſe ut impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ſarta tecta maneat ſuiſque numeris perfecta conſtet etiamſi increduli omnes manen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, nulli eſſent foriè qui fructum ejus perciperent:]</hi> But this is well knowne to any that have but taſted of thoſe diſputes. Now to ſay that he willeth the Salvation of all (if they beleeve) and the damnation of all if they beleeve not, And ſo Chriſt by his death Impetrated Salvation for all, that they might be ſaved if they beleeve, and yet that none might be ſaved if they beleeve not, and ſo (for all any decree of God) all may be incredulous and periſh; if this be not to ſay that Chriſt dyed for all men alike, for like ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know not what is. But yet I ſay their profeſſe words ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this, when they come to give the ſtate of the Queſtion: and ſo to come to my Antagoniſt againe, if he find it not there, I would know where he findeth it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But beſides, I know not how the Author can free himſelfe from this ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe aſſertion: what his judgement is truly, I cannot determine, but ſo farre as his Diſcourſe may aſſure us, we may conclude it, for in <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. where he ſets downe the ends of Chriſt ſo far as concernes Men, as <hi>Pag.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. he concludeth, [That every particular in that generall was for the (world) (all men) (every man.)] Now, to review theſe particulars, I ſay with the Author, Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the juſtice of God for every Son of Adam, and for all indifferently; for no one more than another; he ſatisfied it for all, and he could but ſatisfie it for any. So for a ſecond, Chriſt is the Lord of every man, and not over one more than another, but of all equally: He is abſolute Lord and Soveraigne over all, and he can be no more (as Lord) to any. So for a third, He is the Ranſome of All, and not of one more than another: That which is done for All and every Man, is done for all alike. That which is done to every man (as men) or as ſinners, is done to all, and makes no diſcrimination among men; but all the former are his owne affirmations: whence any may conclude that Chriſt dyed for al men alike, for he mentioneth no other end, ſo farre as Reſpects Ranſome, or Propitiation, but what agreeth to every man alike in his owne reaſoning,</p>
               <p n="3">3. [Some ſay, Chriſt dyed for every man in caſe every man beleeve on him, and for no man in caſe they perſiſt in unbeleife, but this is no Scripture ſenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt hath given himſelfe a Ranſome whether men beleeve it or no.] I conceive the Author cannot produce any that ſo ſtate the Queſtion, (the modell of this plea may be drawne out of the Remonſtrants, with the greateſt probability,) but they ſay no ſuch thing; they do not leave the act of man in beleeving to determine the act of Chriſt as done in and by himſelfe; For then, they cannot prove that he dyed for any, becauſe in their judgement all may be unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and periſh, and yet Chriſt have his end; They ſay as firmely and perſpicuouſly, that (Chriſt dyed for all,<note place="margin">Acta Synod. <hi>4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> whether men beleeve or no,) as the Author himſelfe avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; <hi>[Phraſis illa (Chriſtus mortuus eſt) pro omnibus ſi credant, fupponit, cum

               <p n="4">4. [Some ſay, Jeſus Chriſt dyed in ſome ſort for all men, and ſo as all do receive ſome benefit thereby: He dyed for all men as a Lord, but he did not dye for all as a Surety, to pay the price for, and become the Propitiation for the ſins of all.] The reſult of his thoughts, is like the errand of <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> he ſeeth ſomething but he knoweth not what, ſomething he meaneth if he could but ſpeake. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some he may produce that ſay that all Men, yea all Creatures receive ſome benefit by Chriſts Death; but then he erreth in a twofold reſpect, they neither give this as the ſtate of the Queſtion, neither do they ſay that he dyed for all that receive benefit by his Death; he dyed for no other but men, whoſe nature he undertook, thus Scripture affirmeth; but many more Creatures beſides Men have ſome benefit by Chriſts Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some he may produce that ſay that he obtained Lordſhip and Dominion by his Death, and thus the Remonſtrants ſay,<note place="margin">Corv in Mol. cap <hi>12.</hi> Sect <hi>25</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>[Non obtinuit ut ſalvator ſed ut Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus &amp; Judex eſſet,]</hi> And ſome <hi>contra Remonſt.</hi> thus may affirme, but then he erreth in two particulars; for they do not either give this as the ſtate of the Queſtion, neither do any utter ſuch an impoliſhed expreſſion as this: <hi>[He dyed for all men as Lord,]</hi> this is formed thus in his owne confuſed braine; it was no Act of Lordſhip to dye, but rather as a Servant he dyed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. But to grant all that he ſaith, it deſerveth a little examination how he dealeth with this ſtate of the Queſtion if any ſuch could be produced: he ſaith, [The Affirmative is truth, but not the whole truth; but the Negative denyeth the remainder of truth, and what was before affirmed, for if he did not pay their Price and Purchaſe them, how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpell is he their Lord?]</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unleſſe he will ſay that every man receiveth all good, and the higheſt good by Chriſts Death, (which he cannot prove) he muſt confeſſe that it is the whole truth, that every man receiveth ſome good by his Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſtrongly affirmeth that Chriſt dyed for every man by way of Surety, which is not proveable either by Scripture, or good reaſon; It is againſt the nature of a Surety to doe any thing for one as a Surety, and for the other to be lyable to the ſame thing: hence the ſame debt in a way of juſtice commeth not by any meanes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of both the Surety &amp; the Principall: For this would not be <hi>(Moripro)</hi> but <hi>(Mori cum)</hi> not to dye for, but to dye with men: (Whether this or a different conſideration, I know not) but ſome ſuch thing made the Remonſtr. ſomething ſhye of this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Surety, and in plaine tearmes do deny that it is ſo meant.<note place="margin">Coll. Hag. p. <hi>175, 176.</hi> in Arg. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>[In Collatione dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt fratres ſe hanc formulam ita accipere, ut Chriſtus diceretur mortuum eſſe pro no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis (vadis inſtar) ut pro nobis ſatisfaceret, atqui non ita exprimitur.]</hi> So that it is cleare, that they could not affirme that Chriſt dyed for every man as a Surety; which the Author affirmeth, but doth not prove it to ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He would prove it by this, (becauſe he is their Lord) for he cannot ſee how he ſhould become their Lord if he did not dye for them as Surety, but herein he argueth weakely. No eye ſurely but ſeeth a wide difference betwixt (purchaſing Lordſhip) and (ſatisfying for one as a Surety,) Theſe are no way coincident, the one may be where the other is not; The Iſraelites purchaſed Lordſhip over their ſlaves and
<pb facs="tcp:45603:12"/> Servants, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.44. But they were not ſaid to be Surety for them: So on the other ſide, <hi>Judah</hi> was Surety for <hi>Beniamin, Gen.</hi> 44.33. <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Oneſimus, Philem.</hi> 18. but in neither of theſe was there any purchaſing or Lordſhip; theſe are <hi>(valde diſtantia)</hi> therefore to argue, He is their Lord, therefore he is their Surety, is weake reaſoning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He affirmeth that to deny that Chriſt dyed for all as a Surety, is contrary to what is before affirmed, and ſaith, [If he paid not their price and purchaſed them, how can he be their Lord?] This is grounded on his groſſe perverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he leaveth out the words, (As a Surety) wherein the vigour lyeth; for elſe his words ſhould run thus, [If he pay not a Price for them as a Surety, how can he be their Lord?] And then their weakeneſſe would have appeared to any. Lord he might be, and no Surety; pay a Price for them and purchaſe them to himſelf he may, and yet be no Surety; but he thus produceth the words, [If he payed not a Price for them, how is he their Lord?] This ſavours not of ingenuity, or of one who hath his mouth full of Exclamations againſt perverters of words.</p>
               <p n="5">5. [Some ſay that Chriſt ſo dyed for all, that his death is ſufficient for all, and applicable to all, but not ſo as he hath ranſomed all men, and become the Propitiation for the Sins.] Theſe, or the like expreſſions may be patched up out of ſeverall Judgements; but for one man of either ſide to produce theſe words as the ſtate of the Queſtion, I dare ſay the Author cannot produce any Example.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome ſay, <hi>[Chriſtus mortuus eſt pro omnibus ſufficienter;]</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Coll. Hag. Pag. <hi>124.</hi>
                  </note> (That Chriſt paid a Ranſome ſufficient for the Salvation of all men) I deny not, but then here the Author erreth, it was rather a dogmaticall aſſertion, to ſhew how thoſe words may be received as truth, then a full ſtate of the Queſtion, and it may appeare in that thoſe hot Diſputes have not turned upon this hinge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that ſay, [Chriſt dyed for all ſufficiently,] do not admit of the after-expreſſions, [Applicable to all,] This is the reſult of the adverſe Party. Indeed, the Remonſt. ſcatter ſuch expreſſions, as <hi>[Deus eſt omnibus placabilis] [res impetrata eſt omnibus applicabilis] [omnes ſunt ſalvabiles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Corv. in Mol. c. <hi>28.</hi> Sect. <hi>22</hi> Pag. <hi>446.</hi>
                  </note>] That is, God is placable to all, the thing impetrated applicable to all, all men ſaveable, and ſo the Author, <hi>Pag.</hi> 36. But from any <hi>contra Remonſt.</hi> I thinke he never receiveth any ſuch, and that on good ground I thinke ſo, becauſe it is not ſutable to their Principles. For they that ſay, [Chriſt dyed for all ſufficiently,] meane it, only ſufficiently, and that in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to [effectually] therefore they do in the ſame words deny that he did dye for all (effectually,) and that whether conſidered really or intentionally, that is, Chriſt did neither do it, nor intend to redeeme all effectually, and they that ſo ſay cannot ſay and prove too, that the death of Chriſt, and the good obtained thereby is applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all, and every man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that ſay, [Chriſt hath dyed for all ſufficiently,] doe not ſay, [He hath not ranſomed all men] for as they ſay, Chriſt hath dyed for all ſufficiently, ſo they ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he hath ranſomed all ſufficiently; Seeing, that to (dye for) and to (ranſome) are in Scripture Equipollent. So that we may in this ſee how the Author hallucinates about other mens words: But to let this paſſe as a ſtate given by ſome, let us ſee how he dealeth with it, and with what plea he waveth it as unſound.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith, [The Affirmative of this will ſtand well,] but then he did
<pb facs="tcp:45603:12"/> not conſider that thoſe that ſay, [Chriſt dyed for all ſufficiently,] do meane it only ſufficiently, in oppoſition to [effectually;] but thus it cannot ſtand well with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Diſcourſe, which proveth the Death of Chriſt effectuall for all men. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, [The Negative unſaith the Affirmative,] But how he proveth it ſhall be examined: he urgeth thus: [What ſufficiency is there applicable from Chriſt, or by his Servants, for, or to any man of any thing that Chriſt hath no perfectly wrought, and received in himſelfe, that he might beſtow it according to the Goſpell?] This Phraſe [applicable to all] is foyſted in ſophiſtically, there is no queſtion made of the applicability of any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency that Chriſt did not worke out, and will to apply: but yet a ſufficiency there is in the Bloud of Chriſt, worth, and valour to purchaſe that which it doth not, and for more then he doth effectually redeeme: Were there more worlds, or many more in this world then ever were, or are, or ſhall be, would any doubt but the Bloud of Chriſt had worth and ſufficiency to ranſome them? Nay, if God ſo pleaſed to make his Bloud a price for Devils, who would doubt of the ſufficiency of it to redeeme them? I hope the Author will not deny the Bloud of Chriſt to have ſo much ſufficiency in it, as to merit that every man ſhould undoubtedly be ſaved, but this it doth not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, as he confeſſeth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. His working out Salvation for men was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned out to the valour of his Bloud, but to the grace, and good will of God to men; he did not dye for, or ranſome ſo many as he was able, but ſo many as he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>As for that Phraſe, [<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18, 19, 20.] being produced to prove that there is not an overplus of worth and ſufficiency in the Bloud of Chriſt beyond what effecteth by it; ſheweth what a dexterity the Author hath in being abſurd in his Quotations; that place ſheweth indeed that he received gifts for rebellions, and what gifts he giveth he received, but that he either giveth or received gifts, even to the top of the worth of his Bloud, that the Text ſheweth not.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some ſay, Chriſt dyed for all in regard of the kind or generall lumpe of mankind conſidered, becauſe he tooke the nature of mankind on him, &amp; ſo dyed for all, but did not dye for all in regard of individuals.] I have not ſo much credulity as to beleeve that the Author hath any preſident for ſuch a ſtate of the Queſtion: the expreſſions are too indigeſted to come from any knowing man; to dye for the kind and not the individuals, is to dye for the nature, not the Perſons of men. I feare when his account is caſt up, this will appeare a crude concluſion from more cleare expreſſions, contracting the groſſe Metamorphoſis, from his owne braine.</p>
               <p n="7">7. [Some ſay Chriſt dyed for all men, that they might be ſaved, and for the Elect that they ſhould undoubtedly be ſaved.) Is it not poſſible that any mans Judgement ſhall paſſe his Pen without corruption? I beleeve ſome there are that ſay, [Chriſt dyed for the Elect that they ſhould undoubtedly be ſaved, and for the reſt that they might be ſaved, <hi>viz.</hi> [poſſibly.] So ſome have ſought to cut to themſelves a way betweene the Calviniſts and Remonſt. and of this judgement was one of eminent note in Gods Church.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi>
                  </note> But ſuch a ſtate ſo contradictory as our Author popounds it none ever yet afforded to us; For, let us conſider one branch is, [that all men might be ſaved:] Now, by this is meant (only poſſibly,) and oppoſed
<pb facs="tcp:45603:13"/> to (undoubtedly), or infalibly. Now tell me if all be brought into a (poſſibility only) what place is here left for any to be in an (undoubted infallibility?) It muſt argue either that the Elect are not in the number of (all men,) or elſe that they that are only in a (poſſibility,) are alſo in an [undoubted infallibility] of Salvation, both which the Author will ſay are abſurd. Which ſtate of the Queſtion, the Author approveth not as ſpeaking the whole truth. Therefore I ſhall wave it, and thoſe particulars that he ſaith follow upon it, yet to meet with them in other places: In all which ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I wonder he doth ſo much preſſe upon the credulity of his Readers, in that he produceth not the perſons, and places, by whom, and where the Queſtion is ſo ſtated, that we might ſee how ingenuouſly he dealeth with them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. [Some ſay, that Chriſt by ſhedding of his Bloud, redeemed the world of mankind, ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, and obtained a way of Salvation for every man;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> on <hi>Heard. Pag</hi> 233.</note> (and then adde) But God never intended that the outward Act ſhould ever put man into the poſſeſſion of pardon, or of a ſtate of Juſtification and Salvation:] And for this he citeth an Author. Therefore I ſhall examine this laſt ſtate, and our Authors expreſſes thereon; and I ſhall conſider theſe words in a threefold relation, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Author whom he citeth, to the former ſtating which he rejecteth, to the Queſtion of which he pretendeth it is a ſtate. As they relate to the Author cited by him, I anſwer theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot be either proved or expected, that theſe words ſhould be the ſtate of this Queſtion about Redemption: becauſe that was not his Theame, he treateth there of Reprobation, and therefore no rationall man will expect to find in that Diſcourſe a full ſtate of this Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Author hath got the words of that learned man, but hath left us doubtfull of his meaning; for that Phraſe [He obtained a way of Salvation for every man,] may have a double meaning.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Chriſt hath obtained a way. <hi>viz.</hi> (faith) in which every man that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, ſhall and may through it come to life; intimating thus much only, that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not attainable but by Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Chriſt made that a way with a purpoſe that every man ſhould walk in it, and through it have life. Our Author taketh the words in this ſecond ſenſe, elſe the words of Dr <hi>Davenant</hi> ſerve him not; but thus the words are not taken by him whoſe words they are, and that for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> on <hi>Heard. Pag</hi> 198.</note>1. He expreſly ſaith thus, [The way that he opened for every one of us to partake the fruit of our Redemption, is by Repentance and Faith,] which ſaith no more but this, that the way whereby every man partaketh of Salvation, is Faith and Repentance; or that every man that doth beleeve and repent ſhall come to life, and to this tends his after words, [The Decrees of Election and Reprobation are no obſtacles againſt any that do this,]</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe he ſaith, [Election and Reprobation croſſeth not that.] Now let us conſider the Decrees of Election and Reprobation, he maketh Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to be a denying from Eternity Grace and Glory to the moſt men. And theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> [That God decreed from Eternity to deny both Grace and Glory to the moſt men;] And that [Chriſt opens a way for every man, and ſo for them, as that he intendeth to bring them into life by that way, or that they might be ſo,] are in my thoughts inconſiſtent. Thus as theſe words relate to the Author of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall conſider them as they ſtand compared with the former ſtatings which he rejecteth: And then I demand, what difference there is betwixt this
<pb facs="tcp:45603:13"/> which he receiveth, and the third which he rejecteth? The third ſtate ſaith thus: [He dyed for all, that all might be ſaved if they beleeve, yet they ſhall not if they beleeve not:] And is not this one and the ſame with his laſt ſtate? I cannot ſee any momentous difference; For between theſe two, [Chriſt by his Death impetrated and procured that all men have life if they beleeve, yet ſo as none but them that beleeve ſhould partake of it;] And this, [Chriſt by his Bloud redeemed mankind, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a way of Salvation for every man, (which way is Faith,) and yet this puts not any man preſently into the poſſeſſion of Salvation unleſſe they beleeve;] I need a more piercing Judgement then I have, to find any difference, I ſhall expect to find one in the Authors next.</p>
               <p>Againe, What difference between this which he receiveth, and the firſt which he rejecteth? For that ſaith that the Death of Chriſt is (applicable to all:) Now when this word (applicable) is expreſſed without Sophiſtry, it is meant (only applicable) and ſo in an indifferency either to be applyed or not applyed as the condition is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: So (applicable) is <hi>[applicandum ſi crederent, &amp; non applicandum ſi non crederent;]</hi> That which is only applicable is not to be applied but on condition; and then it is hence <hi>Corvinus</hi> maketh theſe two <hi>(Deus eſt placabilis)</hi> and <hi>(placandus ſi crederent)</hi> to be equipollent tearmes, and this is the true meaning of the word appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. Now betwixt theſe two, [Chriſt by his Death hath made his life applicable to all, that is to be applyed if they beleeve, and not applyed if they beleeve not] And this [Chriſt by his bloudſhed hath obtained a way of Salvation for every man, but God never intended that the outward Act put any man into poſſeſſion unleſſe they beleeve;] I cannot ſee any momentous difference, and the rather I am enduced to thinke ſo, becauſe the reſult of the eighth State which he receiveth is but this, [that all men are ſalvable,] <hi>Pag.</hi> 36. which is one and the ſame with [applicable] which he rejecteth.</p>
               <p>Againe, I would know what this laſt ſtate of the Queſtion which he receiveth, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the ſeventh State which he neglecteth, as not the whole truth: Doth not the firſt part of the ſeaventh, <hi>viz.</hi> [That Chriſt dyed for all men that they might be ſaved] equallize and ſpeake as much as this, <hi>viz</hi> [Chriſt by his Bloud obtained a way to Salvation for every man,] And what is there in the laſt, that is not in the firſt? [To obtain a way to ſalvation for every man,] (which way is Faith) is no more then to ſay, [Chriſt dyed for all men that they might be ſaved by Faith.] And doth not the ſecond Branch in the ſeventh <hi>viz.</hi> [And for the Elect that they ſhould undoubtedly be ſaved,] equallize and ſpeake as much as the ſecond part in the eighth State? <hi>viz.</hi> [None but them that enter into that way of Faith and Repentance ſhall poſſeſſe it:] And what is there in this laſt, that was not couched in that firſt particular? He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth a Plea, which is this: [The diſtinction betwixt the Redemption wrought by Chriſt in himſelf by bloudſhed; and that which he worketh in men by application of his Bloud, is not expreſſed:] But this is empty and groundleſſe, becauſe that diſtinction is not in expreſſe termes in the eighth State, and by as good conſequence in the ſeventh: herein he appeares not ſo quicke ſighted as he pretendeth.</p>
               <q>Diruit, edificat, mutat quadrata rotundis—</q>
               <p>Thus I have examined the laſt State given and received by him, in compariſon with the former, which he neglecteth, and I can ſee no cauſe why the laſt ſhould be entertained when ſeverall others are rejected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let us ſee this State which he ſo eagerly faſtneth on, how it relateth to, or
<pb facs="tcp:45603:14"/> looketh on the Queſtion of which it is a State: the reſult of it is thus, [So that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath ſo dyed and given himſelfe a Ranſome to God for all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That in and by himſelfe he hath ſo redeemed and ſaved all men, that they are given to his diſpoſe, and he will raiſe them out of the death he dyed for them, and make them alive before him. That, they ſhall acknowledge him Lord, and come before his judgement <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9, 12. &amp;c. And he is ſo filled with Spirit for them, to make it ſo knowne, and with ſuch tenderneſſe, that they might be ſaved, ſo all are made ſavable.] When this is embowelled, we ſhall ſee little cauſe why it ſhould be (after the expunging of ſo many Statings) entertained with confidence as that which hath moſt pertinency and light in it; But I ſhall firſt examine the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers apart, and then the whole, conjoyned. In this large reſult, there are included theſe five particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. [That they are given to his dipoſe;] But let the Author ſeriouſly conſider (His opinion being laid aſide a while) whether this Phraſe, [To dye for] as it is ſpoken of Chriſt, hath the ſame meaning with (paying a price for) as any man doth, when he purchaſeth any perſon or thing into his diſpoſe; And is this Phraſe [Given to his diſpoſe] a fit expreſſion for [Ranſome or Redemption?] Ranſome or Redemption when ſpoken of man, alwaies preſuppoſe [miſery] and [liberty] as the tearmes, from which, to which, men are ranſomed and redeemed, but [being given into ones diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,] requireth neither. The Iſraelites had the Heathen in their diſpoſe, but they cannot in reaſon be ſaid to ranſome them, nor to bring them from miſery, and ſlavery, to liberty, but rather the contrary: Beſides, hath not Chriſt all the Creatures on Earth, the Angels in Heaven, the Devils in Hell, in his diſpoſe, for the good of his Church? But it would be no Scripture Language to ſay that he ranſomed, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, all Creatures on Earth, Angels in Heaven, Devils in Hell: Therefore this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, let it ſtand by a while (as of no worth to expreſſe ranſome or redemption by) till we ſee what is in the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. [That he will raiſe them out of the death he dyed for them, and ſet them alive before him:] which expreſſion ſavours much of the confuſion of its Author: His meaning herein dubious, and when ever diſcovered, it will appeare ſenſeleſſe: He muſt have one of theſe two ſenſes, either meaning of the Reſurrection at the laſt day, and ſo affirming, that being raiſed out of the duſt, and being made alive before him out of the duſt, is that ranſome or redemption mentioned in Scripture: Or elſe, that Chriſt dyed for us the ſame death which by his Death he freeth us from, but both abſurd. For the firſt, though it be put as a meanes and way to the poſſeſſion of that inheritance to which we are ranſomed and redeemed; Yet no Scripture giveth the Reſurrection the name of ranſome or redemption, as Chriſt is ſaid to redeeme or ranſome us, and the former very unfit to expreſſe this latter by, for then thoſe that are raiſed by his Judiciary power only, and that to receive their eternall and finall doome in hell, may in that Act be ſaid to be ranſomed and ſaved; but this who can beleeve? So for the ſecond, it is not any whit ſhorter in abſurditie: for the death which we are freed from is no way proportioned by the death which he dyed, we are to be freed from the death we were adjudged to, not what death he dyed himſelf; he came to ſave us ſo farre as we were loſt, but not to be ſo farre loſt himſelfe. Some ſutable proportion of ſufferings which he endured, to them which we deſerved I grant,
<pb facs="tcp:45603:14"/> but where they wanted indurance it was made up by the excellency of the perſon ſuffering; temporary ſufferings of that Perſon that was an infinite God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. did countervaile eternall ſufferings of a finite Creature; we were adjudged to deaths, Temporall, Spirituall, Eternall, but Chriſt did not dye all theſe for us, yet freed us from the two laſt: he dyed the firſt for us and freed us not from it; he dyed not a Spirituall death, that is (in ſin,) for then he had not been an unſpotted Lambe: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. He dyed for our ſins, but we read not that he dyed in our ſins; and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he dyed not, then had he not been juſtified himſelfe, nor juſtified us, yet he freed us from death both Spirituall and Eternall; therefore this expreſſion of the Author is obſcure, confuſed, and however taken abſurdly laid downe, as not reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any right reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. [They ſhall acknowledge him Lord, and come before his Judgement Seat:] that all men acknowledge him Lord, and come to be judged by him none yet deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But that being brought before his judgement ſeat, and being made to confeſſe him Lord, is to be ranſomed and redeemed, none (before our Author) have ever been ſo weake to affirme; for in and by eternall deſtruction men may be cauſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him Lord: but is it a ſober expreſſion to ſay that in eternall deſtruction we are ranſomed and redeemed?</p>
               <p n="4">4. [That he is ſo filled with Spirit for them to make it knowne, and with ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe to them that they might be ſaved.] But what is it which by his Spirit he makes knowne? Scripture telleth us that he is filled with Spirit to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Glad tidings, Liberty. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. But this is none of that god newes, Goſpell, that Chriſt is to Preach; For theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> [all are in his diſpoſe] ſhall be raiſed out of the duſt] ſhall acknowledge him Lord, and ſtand before his Judgement Seat] are no Goſpell newes, no glad tidings to them that call to the hils to cover them from the preſence of the Lambe, but to ſuch theſe particulars equally belong with all others.</p>
               <p>Againe, He is filled with Spirit to make knowne that which requireth the worke of the Spirit to the actuall enjoying of it, and ſo filled with Spirit to give Spirit, that men might enjoy that which he maketh knowne. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. As liberty, opening Priſon doores, Remiſſion of ſins, eternall life, and to the enjoyment of theſe the worke of the Spirit is requiſite, but to thoſe particulars which he furniſheth us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the workes of the Spirit in the hearts of men are no way requiſite; for men are, and ſhall be brought into his diſpoſe, raiſed up out of the duſt, ſtand alive before him, acknowledge him Lord, come before his Judgement Seat, though they never feele the worke of the Spirit upon their hearts; therefore why he ſhould be filled with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to make any or all of theſe knowne, I would be enformed.</p>
               <p>Againe, To make theſe known that men might be ſaved, is not conſonant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Scripture, ſeeing theſe may be done and made known to ſuch men, and at ſuch a time when (in the judgement of all men) they are not ſalvable. Certainely, herein the Author commeth very ſhort, that which he is filled with Spirit to make knowne, that men might be ſaved, goeth further than all thoſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="5">5. [So that all are made ſalvable.] This is the <hi>Helena</hi> on which the Univerſaliſts are ſo enamoured; but this is no congruous expreſſion to expound [Ranſome] and [Redemption,] and [Salvation] by: no not in his owne principles; for [Ranſome] and [Redemption] is to all and every man, as he urgeth: But to be [ſalvable] is not attributed to all men, but to the reſidue that are not Elect. For by [ſalvable] is meant only [ſalvable] and not [infallibly to be ſaved] and ſo <hi>[ſalvandi]</hi> now he ſaith the Elect are undoubtedly to be ſaved, and ſo <hi>[ſalvandi]</hi> and the reſt they are <hi>(ſalvabiles)</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45603:15"/> in a poſſibility of Salvation. Againe, to be but ſalvable, argues that thoſe are equally damnable; for [ſalvable] is, and muſt be taken to be ſaved if they beleeve, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if they beleeve not. Now to ſay that Chriſt came to make men ſalvable only, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that Condemnation had equall ſhare and intereſt in his comming with Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but this is not Scripture Language. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.17. Againe, to be Ranſomed, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, Saved, as Chriſt came to Ranſome, Redeeme, Save, require the worke of the Spirit of God upon the heart: But to [be in a ſalvable condition] doth not. Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might I inſiſt on theſe, but by this it appeares that no one of thoſe particulars mentioned, nor all of them joyntly, do equall thoſe termes of [Ranſome] and [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,] and therefore not well produced as their definition; and hath the Author ever obſerved in all his judicious peruſall of other mens workes, that when it hath been controverted, Whether Chriſt hath ranſomed and redeemed every man, this hath been the reſult of their litigations, Whether all are in his diſpoſe, ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day, acknowledge him Lord, appeare before his judgement ſeat? And doth the Author thinke that this was the judgement of that Learned man whom he eiteth to authorize the laſt State of the Queſtion? Or doth he thinke that when the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is propounded, [whether Chriſt hath dyed for every man] that theſe ſhould be the reſult, and the hinge on which Controverſies turne? I thinke he cannot be ſo ſenſeleſſe. But he herein diſcovers that he puts the ſtate of the Queſtion in that which the word [Ranſome,] [Redemption,] and [dye for] cannot in Scripture Language admit: And as it was never yet by any controverted to this day, therefore how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and learnedly he hath addreſſed himſelfe to this taske, I leave to any to judge. Theſe might have been paſſed by as ſhort of the buſineſſe, yet being thus diſcovered, they let us ſee ſome things concerning the Author.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His ambitious affectation, in ſtuffing his Diſcourſe with ſeeming variety of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings of the Queſtions, thereby to magnifie his vaſt reading, (when indeed he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce them from any Pen,) and his peircing judgement in caſting out (as by an <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi>) that which is Heterodoxall, when every State is abuſed by himſelfe for his owne ends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His groſſe and diſhoneſt perverſion of mens words, producing them in ſuch Formes as may render them ridiculous, and ſubject to his rejection and correction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His great indiſcretion, in troubling the world with an Elaborate Diſcourſe, wherein he commeth not at all to the true ſtate of the Queſtion, nor fully diſcovers to his Readers what he would have, as if he intended nothing elſe, but to let the world know how much he can write to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But to come to ſome more perſpicuous ſtate of the Queſtion as hath been alwaies given, that ſo we may ſee the pertinency and validity of his whole Diſcourſe. I could produce many expreſſions from many Authors about this buſineſſe, who grant an Univerſality, but not in favour to his Tenet, but I will not multiply words, leſt I run upon the ſame Rocke on which the Author hath ſplit himſelfe; neither ſhall I inſert what I find delivered in a dogmaticall way,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Corv. in Mol. Cap. <hi>27.</hi> Sect. <hi>1. 424.</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem]</hi> as ſee may any ſee in the Arminian Tracts: The Teſtimony of that great and acute Remoſt. hath it thus; <hi>[Morte Chriſti omnibus &amp; ſingulis reconciliationem, peccatorum remiſſionem, ac ſalutem aeternam eſſe partam, ſententia noſtra eſt:]</hi> That is, [That by Chriſt his Death, there is procured for every man reconciliation, pardon of ſin, and eternall Salvation, it is our judgement] Therefore that Diſcourſe, and that Propoſition that hold forth no more but this, that he dyed for all and every man, and not ſignifying the determinate end and good that he impetrated for them, comes ſhort of the genuine ſtate of the Queſtion, and that Queſtion is Equivocally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the words ſpoken in purſuance of it are vainly and impertinently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. That I may a little cleare this buſineſſe, and prove to any underſtanding that this ſtate of the Queſtion is to be heeded in theſe Controverſies: The word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is to take its denomination from the miſery which we are redeemed from; according to a Temporall, Spirituall, Eternall miſery, and Thraledome, there is a Temporall, Spirituall, Eternall Redemption; if ſpoken of ſuch a miſery from which all are redeemed, then it is an univerſall Redemption: if of ſuch from which ſome only are redeemed, then it is a ſpeciall Redemption. Now the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which man in generall and every individuall lay under, was graduall, and a complication of more deaths then one, as our Author confeſſeth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 99. where he giveth it the name of deaths in the plurall number, and it is apparant from Scripture, that all kinds of deaths mentioned there, are the fruit of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. By ſin death paſſed, all death, but we find in Scripture a death Temporall, Spirituall, Eternall: as <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.11. By Temporall death we were to loſe our naturall life, a ſeparation of the Soule from the Body, and in that death to loſe all naturall comforts which tended to our comfortable living, and ſo the whole Creation made for our uſe to be reduced to its firſt nothing; By Spirituall death we were to loſe our Spirituall good, the Image of God, and his graces, to become dead in ſins, alienated from the life of God, and ſo to be denyed his glorious preſence for ever, which makes up the greateſt part of Eternall death; this third not being diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the ſecond ſpecifically, but only <hi>[gradu &amp; duratione.]</hi> And to all this there was one degree of miſery more, all this was remedileſly (without a Saviour) and incontinently without delay to fall upon man, <hi>[In the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye the death.]</hi> Now had not Chriſt intervened and interpoſed, the Juſtice of God could not have brooked one moments reſpite. Now here is a great latitude left for Chriſt by his Death to procure ſome good for every Creature, for every man, and yet the freedome from Eternall death, and procurement of Eternall life, not to be ſo generall as to reach to all men. Yea, in this caſe Chriſt did interpoſe, and every man hath benefit by it; Every man is freed from the preſent incumbency of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo to a life of nature, and ſo to the uſe of the Creatures, they being given to man not <hi>quâ (integer)</hi> but <hi>quâ (homo)</hi> and that every man is thus farre redeemed
<pb facs="tcp:45603:16"/> from the incumbency of the miſery none hath denyed, common experience ſhewes. But then whether or no thoſe are ſuch as Chriſt in Scripture Phraſe is ſaid to (dye for) and to ranſome: Or whether to all ſo, and in ſuch a meaſure freed, He is ſaid in Scripture to intend Eternall life, it is very queſtionable, and never yet proved. The end of God and Chriſt in giving ſo much to every man, I will not now either examine or determine: But one we may be furniſhed with from the Author, That though mans condition was ſuch as deſerved the preſent incumbency of the Curſe, yet that, and the execution of many of Gods Eternall purpoſes concerning his Son, and his Elect, could not both have their accompliſhment; God having elected his Son Chriſt to union Hypoſtaticall, and office of a Mediatour, to give and beſtow life to ſuch a number of men whom he had elected to bring infallibly to Grace and Glory, and that abſolutely without any foreſight of faith, or any good, as he granteth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 118, 119. 120. Which Decrees could not have been accompliſhed had the Curſe been ſpeedily and preſently executed, then had not Chriſt been borne, he being to come through the multiplication of ſuch a long Genealogie, nor his Elect had any being to have been the Subjects either of Grace or Glory, many of them being to iſſue from the Loynes of thoſe to whom God had decreed to deny both Grace and Glory: That this was only the ſole and chiefe end of Chriſt in interpoſing, yea for them that never come to have Eternall life, I will not determine, but leave it to the Author to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether there was not ground enough for him to intend ſome good to every man by his Death, and yet not intend eternall life for them? Therefore to let this paſſe for granted, that Chriſt did ſo far interpoſe himſelfe for every man, as to keepe off from him the preſent imcumbency of the miſery, ſo to continue to him his forfeited being, a roome in the world, and the Creatures for his ſubſiſtence. [And could he make it good from <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. that in this ſenſe he hath reconciled the world of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (wherewith God was angry for mans delinquency) ſo far as to have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their borrowed and created being, it could not any thing intrench upon the Queſtion] By vertue of which interpoſall he hath procured, and every man enjoyeth many benefits, I will not undertake to make a full enumeration of them: but let it go thus far, that every good that any man enjoyeth it is a ſtreame flowing from that bloudy ſide of our Saviour; And were it ſo that by vertue of this he might be ſaid to taſte of death for every man, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. To be the Saviour of all men, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. To have bought them that periſh with a ſwift deſtruction, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.

               <p n="1">1. All this wants proofe to be meant, when Chriſt is ſaid to [dye for] and to [Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,] and to [Redeeme,] As if he is ſaid in Scripture Phraſe, to dye for them for
<pb facs="tcp:45603:16"/> whom he procured ſome good. I thinke Scripture doth not ſay Chriſt to have dyed for ſuch, but rather for them that were the chiefe end, and for whoſe fake he gives ſuch mercies to them that never come to have life; as to inſtance, He dyed not for them to whom he gives any outward priviledge, but rather for them for whoſe ſakes they were ſo, that ſo by that they might come to be, and be brought to repentance, and ſo to life. And I would entreat the Author to furniſh me with ſome Arguments to prove that all the good he ſheweth to thoſe men that never come to life, is not ſhewne them for the Elects ſake chiefly; and that the end why the world is not conſumed, is not chiefly that the Elect might in their times and ſeaſons be brought to Repentance.</p>

               <p>As for the Diſcourſe of the Author, it either ariſeth not at all, or very obſcurely to this ſtate in its genuine Altitude, but I find an interwoven miſcellany of expreſſes, ſometimes attempting to riſe to this State, ſometimes receding from it, pitching his thoughts upon a far leſſe degree: As to inſtance, ſomtimes he ſaith, [<hi>He hath wrought for all men that they might be eternally ſaved.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Sence (as the words import) appeares to be, [That Jeſus Chriſt by the grace, good will, and favour of God, did taſte death for every man, and alſo ſo gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ranſom to God for all men: and ſo is become the propitiation for the ſins of the World, and the Saviour of the World.] How pertinently theſe places are produced, any common underſtanding may perceive. The Propoſition may well be received, as proceeding from the Texts alleadged, or with reference to the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. But all being joyntly taken, do not touch the true ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>The firſt Text, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. is peccant in the firſt particular: becauſe it ſaith not, that he gave himſelfe a ranſome for every individuall; and this will appeare a cleare allegation, if we conſider that the Author denyeth not but that all men, is in Scripture ſometimes taken for all ſorts of men, ſometimes for every individuall; Therefore, <hi>Ante factam diſtinctionem,</hi> (as the <hi>Logicians</hi> ſpeake) before diſtinction be made it's equivocall. And all that I would have noted here, is, that it is not the plaine words of the Text, or meaning of it, that he gave himſelfe a ranſome for every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall: but that muſt be fetched from his reaſonings, the validity of which ſhall be examined in their proper place.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45603:17"/>
               <p>The ſecond Text, <hi>viz. Heb.</hi> 2 9. is obnoxious to divers exceptions, as being produced to prove the Queſt. For we muſt refer it to the Author, (or rather to his Oracle) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſuch Text or no. Any that well peruſeth the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, may well quere, Firſt, Whether thoſe words neceſſitate ſuch a reading, as <hi>[He taſted death for every man.]</hi> Secondly, Whether they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a quite diſtinct and much differing reading, and that moſt congruous to the context. Thirdly, Whether if all be granted from the words; yet what this is to the Queſtion, becauſe the words ſay not, neither from them is it urged by the Author, That he taſted death for every man to bring them to Salvation, either abſolutely or upon any condition: I ſay no more of theſe Texts here, becauſe there are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Chapters ſet apart to treate of theſe two Texts ſeverally, therefore there I ſhall ſay more of them; only here I cannot but advertize the Author, that theſe words [He taſted death for every man] are not in plaine expreſſe tearmes in the Text, nor the Tenent, <hi>viz.</hi> (That Chriſt intended to bring every man to eternall Salvation by his death, either abſolutely, or on any condition) is not in plaine tearmes, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in the words, as the Authour falſly ſuggeſts to his ignorant Readers, but in both he muſt be beholding to his owne corrupt inferences and reaſonings which (without prejudice to the Scripture,) may be brought to further diſquiſition.</p>
               <p>As for the Propoſition reſulting from the Texts alleadged, it doth neither good nor hurt; untill it leave thoſe wild generalls, and come to ſome more particulars, it will neither prove friend or enemy to the Queſtion of either ſide.</p>
               <p>It ſaith indeed, that Chriſt did taſte death for every man, but if (the words were to be ſo read) he ſaith not to bring them to eternall Salvation either abſolutely or conditionally; Therfore that an imperfect expreſſion,</p>
               <p>It ſaith indeed, that Chriſt gave himſelfe to God a ranſome for all men: But it doth not ſay that he gave himſelfe a ranſome for every Individuall man; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this an imperfect expreſſion alſo.</p>
               <p>It ſaith indeed, That He is become the propitiation for the ſins of the World, But it ſaith not that he is the propitiation for the ſins of every Individuall; Therefore imperfect.</p>
               <p>It ſaith indeed, That He is the Saviour of the world, but mentioneth not whether he meaneth Saviour of the world with [eternal ſalvation,] whether he actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaveth the world eternally, or merited eternall Salvation for the world upon faith and repentance, or whether he meanes any kind of Salvation: neither doth he ſay that he is the Saviour of every Individuall in the world: this alſo is an imperfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and what the whole is, may be ſeene by a view of the ſeverall parts of it; it is all imperfect as not being at all to the Queſtion: And if it ſhould be reduced to a Syllogiſme it muſt run thus.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt by Gods grace taſted death for every man, and alſo gave himſelfe a ranſome to God for all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then he intended by his death to purchaſe eternall Salvation for every man, either abſolutely, or upon condition.</p>
               <p>But he did do the former: <hi>go:</hi> He did the latter: Then the buſineſſe being thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it remaineth our Authors taske to prove the conſequence of the Major. So that hitherto we ſee no plaine affirmations of Scripture in his Tenent, of which we find ſuch a confident boaſt in his whole Diſcourſe. So that his whole Diſcourſe making out to us no more then he here in the Text pretends, it is no other then a progreſſe in impertinencies.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45603:18"/>
               <p>But for his better underſtanding, he promiſeth five things, which ſucceſſively make up five of his firſt Chapters, all which he mentioneth <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. The firſt whereof takes up his firſt Chapter, and it is the difference betweene,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Redemption, Reconciliation, Salvation wrought by Chriſt in his owne body with God for men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Redemption, Reconciliation, Salvation, which he effecteth by his Spirit in men to God.</p>
               <p>Which diſtinction he ſuppoſeth will make the matter cleare, which indeed, makes the buſineſſe more full of obſcurities then before. For my clearer Anſwer to this rude diſtinction, I muſt alſo premiſe ſome few particulars, if it be poſſible to reduce the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted conceptions of the Author to ſome reaſonable perſpicuity. And they are theſe.</p>
               <p>§. 1. That the word (Salvation) is too wide a field to rove in without a limitation, ſeeing it is a generall terme applicable to any deliverance from any thing that either is, or was an enemy to mans well being. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Sentence that was paſt upon <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Sons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the preſent and ſpeedy execution of it was a grand enemy to mans well being: And the deliverance from it (even in the next moment of reprievall) might deſerve the name of Salvation; though I know no one place that ſpeakes of it under this notion of Salvation; nor doth it acknowledg the love of God to be expreſſed to any only in this, and no further.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Any outward temporary miſery, thraldome, danger, is an enemy to mans well-being; and a deliverance from ſuch hath in Scripture the name of Salvation. <hi>Act.</hi> 27.31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Jude</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ignorance (of God, and Jeſus Chriſt our Peace) which is in us, is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to our well-being; ſeeing that without Hearing no Faith, without Faith no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him: therefore the deliverance from this ignorance by the comming of the Goſpell, and the preaching of it, is in Scripture called a Salvation. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.6. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.28. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The wrath of God which he hath conceived againſt ſinners is an enemy to our well-being; and to be delivered from it by Reconciliation is a Salvation: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. &amp; 15. And if Reconciliation be not a Salvation, why puts the Author them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as being Synonimous?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The enmity in our hearts againſt God is an enemy againſt our well being; and to be delivered from it by Converſion and effectuall Calling is Salvation. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19, 9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. Nay, although it is but a graduall emendation of mens lives in regard of ſome groſſe ſins to which they were formerly given, is Salvation. <hi>Jude</hi> 23.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Any want or imperfection comming ſhort of that bleſſed ſtate of Innocency is an enemy alſo, therefore to be in conſummate and compleat happineſſe in Heaven is Salvation <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sometimes the word Salvation is comprehending all theſe, as <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. And in any place where Chriſt is ſaid to come to be the [Saviour of his people.] Theſe being conſidered, that Diſcourſe that treates of Salvation indefinitely, without a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification of what Salvation it is meant, is but a rambling in obſcurities.</p>
               <p>§. 2. That to the enjoyment of any one of theſe, or all theſe, there are two diſtinct Acts requiſite, <hi>viz.</hi> Impetration or Merit, and actuall Application, or beſtowing of it, according to Merit and Purchaſe. It is againſt his wiſdome to impetrate a benefit at ſo deare a rate without applying it, or intention to apply it. It is againſt his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and perfection not to apply that which he intended to apply, and againſt his Juſtice to apply any Salvation, without that Application or Salvation applied were firſt
<pb facs="tcp:45603:18"/> merited and impetrated. Hence it may be truly ſaid, <hi>[Impetratio eſt applicationis fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum, &amp; applicatio eſt impetrationis complementum]</hi> Impetration is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Application, and Application the Complement and perfection of Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and both together make an entire Salvation. And the firſt Act, <hi>viz.</hi> Impetration, or Merit, is not, nor can be called Salvation, Reconciliation, Redemption, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then Metonimically; as Chriſt himſelfe is called our Salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. and our Peace. And ſo it is called Salvation, with reference to the Salvation perfectly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, either as actually done, or as infallibly in time to be done. But properly Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not wrought perfectly in Chriſt, for they are <hi>(opera ad extra)</hi> neceſſarily requiring an object without, and they muſt be terminated upon the Creature; as there is no Act without an Object, ſo no Salvation, or Reconciliation, except there be ſome that are reconciled: and if they be in the firſt Act reconciled or ſaved, in any of the forementioned degrees, the ſecond Act is fruſtaneous in reſpect of that degree. And the Remonſt. though they gave it the name of Reconciliation, Redemption, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, yet they carefully expreſt themſelves how they meant:<note place="margin">Acta Synod. <hi>289</hi> Corv in Mol. cap <hi>28.</hi> Sect <hi>11. pag 437.</hi>
                  </note> Not that any Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or Reconciliation were actually wrought for men, or acted upon the Creature, but that they were in ſuch a condition that God would be reconciled upon ſuch and ſuch conditions, therfore called Salvation, becauſe there may be a Salvation &amp; Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, but not that there is one actually; therefore that Diſcourſe that confidently tearmes that firſt act done in Chriſt a ſalvation, Reconciliation, Redemption, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further explanation, evidenceth that the Author is willing to lye under the cenſure of an Impropriety, that he may lye hid in obſcure expreſſions.</p>
               <p>§: 3. That thoſe two Actions <hi>viz.</hi> Impetration, or Merit, and actuall conferring or applying any of thoſe forementioned ſalvations belong not both to the ſame party to do. The firſt is Chriſts, and ſo his as none elſe, he alone as Mediatour ſatisfied and merited becauſe he only dyed. But the actuall conferring of any Salvation is ſo Chriſts, as it is alſo the worke of the Father, and ſo not of Chriſt as Mediatour, but then his as having a ſhare in the offended Deity: And for this the frequent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Remonſt. are ſufficient Teſtimonies to them that adhere to there prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: as <hi>[Chriſtus impetravit ut Deus poſſit ſua beneficia communicare,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:45603:19"/> (neither was there ever any need ſo to do) but the difference hath been about the diviſion of them, Whether they may be divided one from the other or no?

And in reaſon it will follow that if it be Chriſts taske as Mediatour only to Impetrate, then all his Acts as Mediatour muſt go to the perfecting the Impetration? It was not Death barely that did merit Salvation, but the death of ſuch a one as muſt overcome Death, and ſo preſent himſelfe before God in Heaven, that could effect that buſineſſe. As in the Law there was <hi>Mactatio Sacrificii,</hi> and <hi>Oſtenſio Sunguinis,</hi> The killing of the Sacrifice, and ſhewing the Bloud within the veile, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.11, 15. Without which no Atonement made, no not ſo much as appertained to the Prieſt: So no Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment purchaſed or merited without the Mactation of the Lambe (on the Croſſe,) and the Oſtenſion of his Bloud within the veile in Heaven in his Aſcention, which is called his appearing in Heaven for us; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12, 24. And that appearing for, it muſt needs be part of his Impetration, elſe ſhould he not anſwer his Type; the Prieſt in the Law was to offer a Sacrifice, and to offer Prayers for the People, ſo Chriſt alſo out High Prieſt. Hence is it that Chriſt makes this an end of leaving the World, viz. <hi>To prepare a place, Joh.</hi> 14.2, 3. He ſaith not to beſtow a place, but to prepare; without which aſcending to Heaven, and ſhewing himſelfe there that he had ſhaken off mans ſins, and overcommed death, the Kingdome had not been ſufficiently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. And hence is it, as I conceive, that he ſaith, <hi>If I goe not away the Comforter cannot come,</hi> either in the powerfull operations of his Grace, or comfortable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of his Spirit, that he could not ſcale any comfortable tidings to their hearts that Chriſt had done for them if he had not aſcended, that finiſhing his Impetration he aſcending ſent him to them. Thus the Author grants, <hi>Pag.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He appeares and Advocates for us to procure pardon of ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to preſent himſelf, and the Covenant of precious Promiſes, therefore his aſcending, and Advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs to the impetration or procuring life. Hence that Diſcourſe that divideth the Acts of Chriſt about our Salvation, and that as Mediatour, ſome to Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:45603:19"/> others to Application as he doth, is not ſound and Orthodox.</p>
               <p>Which generals being well conſidered will make way to the methodicall exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Authors diſtinction, and his Diſcourſe upon it. The diſtinction followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Salvation, Redemption, Reconciliation, which Chriſt hath wrought in his body with God for men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Salvation, Redemption, Reconciliation, which Chriſt hath effected by his Spirit in men to God.</p>
               <p>Which diſtinction, the Author excudes to that end it might be both heeded and underſtood, which if he had as really intended as he ſpake, he would have made it to bring pertinency and perſpicuity along with it; pertinency, that it might deſerve to have been heeded, and perſpicuity with it, that it might be in a capacity of being underſtood; but ſo wild are his expreſſions herein, that his Reader is put to a double taske, both to ſearch out his intricate meaning, and alſo to refell it; the firſt being of farre greater difficulty, which ſavours not of Controverſall ingenuity. And that which (by his other expreſſes) we may conjecture to be his meaning, being granted in its latitude, affords no cleare deciſion to the Controverted truth, as in the cloſe of this Chapter I ſhall ſhew.</p>
               <p>It is not eaſie to determine whether by this diſtinction, our Author intends to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover two diſtinct Salvations wrought by Chriſt, or two diſtinct Acts in Chriſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and effecting one and the ſame Salvation; which if our Author had heeded to diſcover, his Diſcourſe had more tended to ſatiſfaction, and been better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>If he meane diſtinct Salvations, then he ſhould have diſcovered what they are, and how diſtinct; for truth we may grant in this thus taken, That there is a Salvation from the preſent Incumbency of the miſery wrought out and effected by Chriſt for all men: And there is a Salvation from enmity of heart, by effectuall calling wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, and this is to none but Beleevers: But what cleareneſſe this bringeth to the Controverſie in hand, is not yet cleare to me.</p>
               <p>Beſides if he thus meane, though theſe Salvations be diſtinct, yet as his diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is cloathed, with circumſtances it falleth to the ground; for his firſt Salvation he ſpeakes of is ſo wrought out (for men) that it is not done (in) or (upon men,) but ſuch is not the Salvation from the preſent incumbency of the Curſe, for that is ſo wrought out (for) that it is alſo acted (upon) men, applyed to every man, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing requiſite to the application of that but what is common to all men: And his ſecond Salvation is ſo wrought (in men) that is diſtinct from, and oppoſed to, wrought out (for men) (els his diſtinction is not good) but this is falſe, for no Salvation is wrought in or upon men, but it is wrought out for men, Impetration being the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Application; therefore theſe two are ill brought as members contra-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, ſeeing they are coincident in one and the ſame Redemption.</p>
               <p>But if he meane, his diſtiction of two Acts concurring to every Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> a [working for] and a [beſtowing upon] a procuring for, and applying to; As I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he doth, not only becauſe this diſtinction is in uſe in all Arminian Tracts in this Point, as the buſineſſe of their elaborate ſtructures, and the hinge about which they turne: But alſo from our Authors owne expreſſions in every leafe almoſt of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, as to inſtance, [The pardon procured, and in his hands to beſtow, <hi>Pag.</hi> 42, 43.] [He would work out a Redemption, and procure life, and it is in him for men, <hi>Pa.</hi> 50.] [If Chriſt had ſhed no Bloud to procure remiſſion for them, <hi>Page</hi> 137.] [He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Salvation, and made them ſalvable, and calleth them that they might be ſaved, <hi>Pag.</hi> 157, 158.] By all which and many more it appeareth plainly, that by his firſt
<pb facs="tcp:45603:20"/> Salvation he meaneth no more then the firſt Act of Chriſt in procuring or meriting of Salvation: And by the ſecond he meaneth the Actuall applying of it upon ſuch conditions performed; and if this be all, I muſt enforme him that this hath been well heeded long ſince, and fully underſtood, and yet the buſineſſe not cleared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt of his ſide.</p>
               <p>And I would then know, Whether his diſtinction be not ſomething allied to that of the Arminians of [Impetration and Application] the one for [every Man,] the ſecond for [Beleevers] only, and what difference there is betwixt him and an Arminian? Save only that his expreſſions are more abſurd: though he cryeth out of a heavy Calumny ſo to be charged. And when our Author gives a more diſtinct diſcovery of himſelfe, he ſhall have a more diſtinct Anſwer.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I ſhall examine both members of his diſtinction apart; of the firſt now, and firſt to conſider his expreſſions in it: Secondly, the Scriptures he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to backe it. The members run thus:</p>
               <p>[A Salvation, Reconciliation, Redemption, which Chriſt hath wrought in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for men, with God.] Wherein,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I deſire ſatisfaction, why he calleth the Act of Chriſt in meriting or procuring life for men A Salvation, without further explanation: Meriting or procuring being an Act, relateth to the Agent, and is terminated in him, but Salvation is a tranſient Act that runneth into an Object: It is an effect, and therefore muſt have an object on which it is wrought. Salvation is <hi>(opus ad extra)</hi> and therefore to ſay that that is terminated in Chriſt, is abſurd; As it is a worke <hi>ad extra,</hi> ſo it might have an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>(ad extra)</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">Corv. in Mol. Cap. <hi>28.</hi> Sect. <hi>11</hi>
                  </note> and if none be ſaved, there is no Salvation. Indeed, the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants called it a [Reconciliation,] but then they explaine themſelves, that it is not an actuall Reconciliation: But therefore called ſo, becauſe Reconciliation is procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and if the Author had ſo diſcovered himſelfe he had been ingenuous; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in my Reaſon is not ſatisfied. That thoſe things that are procured, And in time to come to paſſe, may be laid downe as being in Act, when they are not ſo, becauſe of the infallible futurition, I grant: as he that beleeveth not is condemned, and he that beleeveth hath eternall life, Scripture thus ſpeaketh; but that the act of Chriſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing only that men may have life, notwithſtanding which moſt men periſh; and the end whereof is not the Salvation of men, that ſuch an act ſhould be Salvation, Reconciliation, Redemption, neither Scripture nor Reaſon ſpeaketh; therefore I demand a reaſon of that his expreſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why he ſo expreſſeth it, as if the firſt Act, <hi>viz.</hi> of Impetration or merit was in Scripture Phraſe, as done [in his body,] when the Scripture ſaith, the ſecond Act, <hi>viz.</hi> of Application is done <hi>[In that body of his fleſh,] Col.</hi> 1.20. Which place evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treateth of the application of his Death, and Reconciliation of their hearts to God by being brought in to beleeve, who were ſtrangers and enemies in heart to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet notwithſtanding this is ſaid to be [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] in that body of his fleſh, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonder why our Author ſhould produce ſuch an expreſſion, (making it the ſeat of Controverſie) without further explanation, when it ſo eaſily might be explained; Let him tell me how that Reconciliation was wrought [in Chriſts Body,] Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is a thing ſubjectated in God,<note place="margin">Xanchy in locum.</note> exiſting only <hi>[in mente divina]</hi> not in Chriſts Body. Expoſitours to cleare this unanimouſly ſay, that [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] is put for [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] [In] for [by,] as is moſt frequent in Scripture, as one ſaith, <hi>[Quaſi dicat reconciliavit per oblationem Corporis ſui,]</hi> And therefore ſaid to be [In his Body,] becauſe it was done by thoſe ſufferings which were ſubjectated in his Body, in which regard he was ſaid to beare our ſins in his Body, (that is, the puniſhment of our ſins,) but our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
<pb facs="tcp:45603:20"/> properly is not ſaid to be in [his Body.] That indeed whereby he merited it was in his Body. The meanes of our Reconciliation are twofold in Scripture, [His Body,] and [His Bloud,] the one broken, the other ſhed; but of this latter it is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, by his Body] <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. If this be ſo, then not the firſt Redemption, or procuring of Salvation, or Reconciliation only; but the ſecond alſo, even the application of it is ſaid, and alſo truly is (In) that is (by his Body) Seeing that we are ſaid to be redeemed [by his Bloud,] <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. Which place our Author averreth to be meant of the application of Chriſts Death, therefore the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribing that firſt Redemption with this Phraſe (In his Body) is groundleſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſhall view the expreſſions wherewith this is clothed, that ſo we may Judge how pertinent his alleadged Scriptures are, [it being his boaſt that he hath ſo many plain Texts.] Firſt, It is ſaid to be an Act of Chriſt as Mediator diſtinct from God the offended Party. Secondly, to be done [in his body] as oppoſed to be [done by his ſpirit.] Thirdly, With God for men, as oppoſed to [of God upon man.] Fourthly A reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God to man as oppoſed to [reconciling man to God.] Fifthly, This is ſaid to be for every man.

And ſo had the worke of God on their hearts by his Miniſtry, certainly in ſuch a time; if they ſay [his is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World] they meane ſuch a Salvation as is by faith in Chriſt: Now what that is let the Authour judge. And he ſaid to be the Saviour of the world, becauſe they knew he it was that came to merit Salvation, ſo as it ſhould be applyed in time by Faith. Shall we take the liberty thus to expound Scripture, and ſay, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. <hi>[He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins,]</hi> That is, he ſhall worke out with God a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which yet may not be applyed?

How ſhall we herein perplexe the Word of God? Let the Author ſhew me where Chriſt, or God is called Saviours and reſpect not had to the Application of Salvation either preſent or to come. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.37. He is a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and forgiveneſſe of ſins.

This cannot be the meaning of the word [Propitiation] when ſpoken of Beleevers, becauſe they do beleeve and ſo have it applyed: And let the Author ſhew where he is called a Propitiation, or ſaid to be one, but where mention is made of Beleevers; and theſe things being conſidered, I wonder why our Author, or any Remonſt. whatever, can (upon their owne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) produce this Text to prove that which they would have done to all and every man; when it is granted by them that Reconciliation is not applyed to all. Now to conclude this Text, He is ſaid a Propitiation, in that by vertue of his Mediation, Reconciliation is applyed, as he is ſaid to be our Peace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. and our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Sanctification, and both metonimically; And that he may be ſaid to be a Propitiation for them that do not yet beleeve, I will not contend againſt it, but men it is with reſpect had to the certaine futurition of it, which is all one in this point with the other.</p>
               <p>And that this Phraſe, [He is a Propitiation,] neceſſarily preſuppoſeth his meriting and procuring remiſſion, as the ground of application, I grant: But that it doth not principally point at actuall Remiſſion, (whereby he is ſaid to be a Propitiation) the Author ſhould do well to prove. Theſe I tranſmit to the diſquiſition of the Author, expecting ſatisfaction in the Premiſes, for this will helpe us in two points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this place doth not favour any ſuch Salvation wrought by Chriſt with God, diſtinguiſhed and diviſible from the application, and ſuch as may be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and as done for, every Son of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>

Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a while of the time of which it is ſaid, God [was] reconciling; Some I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, (and of worth) hold, that this is meant from Eternity, ſo he was reconciling, that is, preparing a way to reconcile the world to himſelfe, and were the words alone I ſhould ſubſcribe to this, but as the words run I cannot ſee the neceſſity or congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Expoſition; becauſe the words run, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Intimating, that then when he was reconciling the world to himſelfe, he was alſo putting into the Apoſtles the word of Reconciliation, which I conceive not to be done from Eternity but in time.</p>
               <p>And happily our Author may ſay (He was,) that is, when Chriſt offered himſelfe on the Croſſe; But neither this congruous, for he put the word into the Apoſtles before the time of his offering himſelfe: I rather for the preſent conceive, that the Text meaneth of the reconciling of the hearts of men to God by the Goſpells Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: When he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: That is, when he was giving it to them by Commiſſion, and putting it into them by inſpiration, then was he reconciling the world to himſelfe in that Miniſtration; And it appeareth to be ſuch a Reconciliation as is effected by the word of Reconciliation, but ſuch is that whereby we are reconciled in our hearts to God: And ſo it ſaid to be of the (world) that is, men living in the world; and to be (in Chriſt) as God is ſaid to bleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:45603:22"/> us with all Spirituall bleſſings, (even effectuall Calling and Converſion) in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3.

               <p>This ſenſe of the Text I tranſmit to the Judgement of the Learned, and till I ſee further, I muſt conclude that this Text ſpeakes of the Application of Reconciliation, and that of Gods Act (by vertue of Chriſts merit) in the Goſpels Miniſtry, and not of the Act of Chriſt with God for men, there is no one word that favoureth ſuch a conceit; and if this be true, then it not only ſheweth that where the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Application of Reconciliation, yet uſeth ſuch a generall expreſſion as the (world,) which yet in every Judgement is not common to every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may conclude that the word (world) doth not imply in it every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> which may ſtand in ſome ſtead in this Point: but alſo it faileth the Author and ſerveth him not for his purpoſe, to ſet forth ſuch a procuring of Reconciliation, as may be ſeparated from the Application.</p>

               <p>[<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. That taketh away the ſins of the World.] That this place preſuppoſeth the Act of Chriſt in meriting and procuring Remiſſion, I grant; but to ſay that it doth not alſo include the Application thereof ſeemeth improbable; Can Sin be taken away and the Bloud of Chriſt not applyed? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.7. There taking away Sin is expounded by having ſin purged away; but to have Sin purged away is not but by bloud ſprinkling, and ſo in the Authors Divinity the application of the Bloud of Chriſt. Let the Author conſult with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.27. And let him tell me whether that taking away ſin be the Application of the Death of Chriſt or no? Happily the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or ſome for him may ſay, when God taketh away Sin that is the Application, but when Chriſt takes away Sin that is the Impetration of Remiſſion. Let it be ſo, but then Chriſt in his Impetration looked at the Actuall taking away of ſin, and it followeth in time, elſe could not he in that Act of his be ſaid to take away Sinne. All which places being laid together, as being produced to prove his firſt Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are a heape of miſtakes; and whereas he profeſſeth himſelfe to have read the Scriptures ten times over, I muſt conclude that he wanteth common underſtanding to ballance his reading, or by over affecting his cauſe, willing to betray his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to weak conceits, and for his firſt Branch we muſt either have new proofes, or theſe created. But were they effectuall for his purpoſe? Yet, why are they produced in this Controverſie? They only prove thus much, that Chriſt did impetrate and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Remiſſion and Life; this none yet that I know deny but the Socinian, with whom I thinke he engageth not.</p>
               <p>Having laid downe his firſt Redemption; attended with a ſufficient Traine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Scriptures, he proceedeth to lay downe the ſeverall particulars or grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which Chriſt did aſcend to this worke for men: Why, by the way, let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obſerve where they are not proved to be for all and every man, they are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and where he attempteth ſo to prove, ſhall be brought to the Teſt,</p>

We grant that he did purchaſe Life, it was his worke, and to that end he was made fleſh and came into the world, and this is true though he purchaſed Life for none but the Elect; but yet theſe are not well martialled and ranked: I would know a reaſon why his being made fleſh is ſet in order as ſecond to his manifeſtation and comming into the world? He was made fleſh in his Conception, but he came not into the world till his Nativity: But it is abſurd to ſay, firſt he was Borne, ſecondly, conceived, but of this ſort is the Authors Method: as if even thoſe things that did nothing at all engage him, he could not name them without bewraying himſelfe.</p>

Being thus in the nature of mankind he was ſet and ſtood a publique Perſon in the Nature and roome of all mankind.] Here lye confounded expreſſions of a different nature; To be [A publique Perſon,] and [In the Nature of Mankind,] and in [The roome of all Mankind,] are different one from the other, and all of them ſhort of clearing the truth of his procuring Life for every Son of <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:45603:24"/>1.

               <p>For the ſecond, [His being in the Nature of mankind,] is a truth, but if produced to prove his procuring Life for every man, is very weake: For if Chriſt had redeemed far fewer then he doth, yet it would be requiſite for him to take upon him the Nature of Man, and ſtand in the kind, for he could not (as God had decreed it) redeeme any one Perſon but he muſt take upon him the nature of Man: Therefore to argue thus, He tooke upon him the nature of man, therefore he ſtood in the roome of every Individuall, is not valid Argumentation: Yet this is the reaſoning of <hi>Arminius, Naturam aſſumpſit humanam omnibus communem, reſpectu cujus non eſt inter homines differentia.</hi> In <hi>Perkin.</hi> 74.</p>
               <p>For the third, [Standing in the roome of Mankind;] The Expreſſion is either improper or falſe; for him to ſtand in the nature of Mankind is true and well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe <hi>(Naturam aſſumpſit non perſonam hominis)</hi> he aſſumed the nature not the perſon of man, and the nature is rather of the kind or ſpecies than of the Individualls, therefore we may ſay he ſtood in the nature of mankind: But to ſay Chriſt ſtood in the roome of mankind is improper; for (His ſtanding in the roome of) the effect and benefit of was intended to particulars, Individuals are repreſented, not the kind of man: Thus we find it expreſſed in theſe Diſputes,<note place="margin">Twiſſe vind. grat. <hi>266.</hi> Corv. in.

But happily by All mankind, he may meane all the Individuals of mankind, but then it is falſe, and reſts ſtill at his unperformed taske to prove, that Chriſt did ſtand in the roome of every Individuall. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I expreſſe wherein he attempteth to prove it, by ſome reaſon and ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his Reaſon is this, [As <hi>Adam</hi> did who was the Figure of him that was to come.] Thus arguing: <hi>Adam</hi> as publique perſon, ſtood in the roome of every Individuall man in the world, whereby all and every individuall comes to be plunged in ſin and miſery; therefore Chriſt being to anſwer him as the Figure, muſt ſtand in the room of all Individuals alſo, but the ſtrength of theſe I ſhall examine in a few words. I hope the Author will not ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the roome of any but his Off-ſping, and thoſe that ſhould come of his Loynes by naturall propagation, and ſo thoſe that were to come of him And that he ſtood in the roome of any man in any other Notion than as comming from him naturally, I would have the Author to prove, and for this reaſon, that our Saviour though he was an Individuall man, yet not comming by naturall propagation, but ſupernaturall overſhadowing the Virgin, and ſo without the helpe of man, and ſo was it that he came out of the Loines of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Author ſaith, <hi>Pag</hi> 119. Hence was it I ſay, that he had no ſin, he was not under that generall Contagion that lyeth upon all <hi>Adams</hi> Sons, he was not
<pb facs="tcp:45603:25"/> defiled from him; and let me put this ſuppoſition, If God ſhould now, as at firſt, Create more men, they not comming from <hi>Adam</hi> by Propagation, they ſhould not be intereſted into <hi>Adams</hi> Sin and Curſe, therfore it is cleare that <hi>Adam</hi> did ſtand in the roome of men, not as men, but as his Sons, and to come from him. Now let the Compariſon go forward, and let Chriſt anſwer his Type: <hi>Adam</hi> as a publique Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtood in the roome of all his Poſterity, and thoſe that are his Sons and come from him: So Chriſt ſtandeth in the roome of all thoſe that are his Sons, and come to have a being from him: If he ſhould ſtand in the roome of more he ſhould not anſwer his Figure; but this he might do though he ſtood in the roome of the Elect only, for none elſe come to have a being from him, and to be his Sons; So that it ſeemeth cleare, that the Compariſon betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt lyeth not in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defined number of Individuals, but the relation wherein they ſtand each kind to their owne root; So that here is little in reaſon, I ſhall examine his Scriptures. They are two.</p>
               <p>[1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22, 45, 46. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14, 18, 19.] That theſe places hold forth thus much, that as <hi>Adam</hi> was the Fountaine of Death, ſo Chriſt of Life: As <hi>Adam</hi> conveyed Death to all his, ſo Chriſt Life to all his, I grant; but if he will have any further, let him bring good probation and I ſhall examine it; Let us conſider his alleaged places ſeverally.</p>

Such an Aſſertion as this <hi>viz.</hi> That Pardon, covering, not imputing Sins, is the priviledge of every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> I leave to the Founder of it, and muſt diſſent till I find more cauſe of embracing it.</p>

[Innumerable evils have compaſſed me, mine iniquities have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hold on me,] What he will hence infere I cannot well determine; true it is that hence he may inferre that Chriſt was incompaſſed with innumerable evills, and that very many Sins had taken hold upon him, and that thoſe Iniquities which he had undertooke to anſwer for, tooke hold on him, whereby he might ſay Mine Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath taken hold on me, But what is this to the Point in hand I know not? If he intend hereby to prove that all the evills of every man had taken hold on him, this is a weake inference: But thus farre I conclude with him, that all thoſe for whoſe Sins he undertook, he ſtood charged with all their ſins that the Law could charge them with, but that he ſtood charged with all the ſins that the Law could charge any man withall, that is yet to be proved.</p>
               <p n="6">6. [Having on him our Sins, God laid on him the puniſhment and
<pb facs="tcp:45603:26"/> Curſe that was due to us for thoſe ſins, and ſo dyed as a Sinner in the roome of us all.] This is for ſubſtance nothing diſtinct from the former, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt [His being charged with our Sins] and [Having our Sins imputed to him,] and his [Having the puniſhment of our Sins laid on him,] there is no difference; Yet here are ſome improper ſpeeches and fallacies. Improprieties I ſay in the firſt words, [Having on him our Sins, God laid on him the puniſhment of Sins;] It is beyond my capacity to conceive how Chriſt had on him our Sins, before he had on him the puniſhment of our Sins; he had not Sin formally, but only imputatively he bare our Sins: True, but that is Metonimically, Sins for the puniſhment of our Sins, and then was it when he was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.5. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not where the Scripture ever ſpeaketh Chriſt to have our Sins on him as diſtinct from his having the puniſhment of them on him; Therefore if he make them diſtinct he muſt free it from Impropriety, if they be the ſame, then from a vaine Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</p>
               <p>The fallacy is in the next words, [In the roome of us all.] If the Author meanes as the Apoſtles and Prophets did and muſt (in the Authors owne Principles from the change of Perſons) (us all) that is, we all that are Beleevers, then it is true, but nothing to his purpoſe; But if by (us all) he would underſtand [Every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi>] it would be indeed pertinent to his buſineſſe, but falſe and deſtitute of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, he inſtanceth in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. Which cannot cleare that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of them under the Notion of men, and ſo in common with all men, but as Beleevers, and ſo proper to them: And this the Authour puts out of doubt in his owne inference from the change of Perſons. And certainly the Apoſtle writing to Beleevers, ſaying, He was made ſin for us all, can afford no ſuch Interpretation. He attempts to prove it by 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. For we thus judg, that if Chriſt dyed for all, then are all dead, and he dyed for all, that they which live might not live to themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] The ſenſe of which Text, if it favour him, muſt run thus, For we thus judge, that if Chriſt dyed for every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> then was every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> dead, and he dyed for every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> that they that live might not live to themſelves but to him that hath dyed for them;] but I leave this to every Intelligent Reader, to judge whether it be not herein ſet upon the racke: This cannot be produced from the words themſelves, nor made well to accord with the foregoing or following words, but he loveth to give us words without any meaning. But I deſire the Author or any Reader to examine whether this be not the ſenſe? For we thus judge, that if Chriſt have dyed for all, [That is in Scripture Phraſe, for all whom he intended to bring to Salvation; all thoſe whom his Father had (for that end) given him;] Then have all dyed, [that is, all thoſe for whom he dyed have dyed to ſin.] [Now the ground of this is, the Connection betwixt the end of Chriſt, and the execution of it in the next words:] And he dyed for all, that thoſe that live [not the life of Nature, but of Grace and Faith,] might not live to themſelves, but to him that hath dyed and roſe againe. Now in this Expoſition theſe two things are only to be proved: Then other things will follow, and they are theſe; Firſt, That that Phraſe [Then are all dead] is meant death not (in) but (to) Sin. Secondly, That the Phraſe [That they which live] is meant of a Life of Grace and Faith, not the Life of Nature: Which being cleared, the place will not only not help him, but affoord a good Argument againſt him; which particulars I ſhall cleare by theſe foure particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtles ſcope in this preſent Chapter, that which he is about in this and
<pb facs="tcp:45603:27"/> the foregoing Chapter, is to ſhew the beleeving <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he with the reſt of the Apoſtles, did neglect earthly things and were heavenly minded, and deſired to approve themſelves to God, and for their good, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13. And alſo to preſſe the ſame upon them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. Now that thoſe words, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14, 15, Containe an Argument to prove and backe this, is evident; and that to ſhew a ground why they did ſo, and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould do ſo; and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is drawne from the Death of Chriſt; [For we thus judge, that if Chriſt dyed for all, then are all dead;] Now it may be queſtioned whether this Argument be drawne from the cauſe, or the effect of Chriſts Death, that is, whether he meaneth thus, Then were all dead in Sin, and ſo need to live to God: Or thus, Then have all dyed, that is, in Chriſt that dyed, in whom the Sins of Beleevers were crucified, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. Happily our Author will ſay the firſt, but I conceive that is not his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Text, and that on theſe two grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe then the Apoſtles Argument to Beleevers is not ſo oppoſite and full, becauſe there was no greater engagement on them to live to God, then upon every Son of <hi>Adam;</hi> which agreeth not with the whole ſeries of the Word of God,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe then the words of the Apoſtles ſhould have run thus, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. For the Condition of Man conſtraineth us, and layeth a neceſſity on us and others to live to God and not as they do. The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us; And if the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be drawne from the effect of Chriſts Death, Then it is cleare the meaning is this, Then are all dead; all for whom he dyed for are dead, have their old man cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him, and ſo are or ſhall certainly have ſin weakened and killed, and live to God, becauſe he dyed for that end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the Apoſtles expreſſes in the foregoing Chapter, where he mentioneth that Life which he here inſerts, and may herein be his own Expoſitour: <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. That the Life of Jeſus Chriſt might be manifeſt in our Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where life is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly taken for a Spirituall Life, which he ſpeakes of, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.7, We walke by Faith, is nothing but we live by Faith, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. And theſe may expound <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. where he ſaith, [That thoſe that live muſt not live to themſelves,] Where it is thus meant, that thoſe that live the life of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. From the uſuall Phraſe of the Apoſtles in other places when he perſwadeth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers to the ſame duties, and uſeth the ſame Argument, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. the twelve firſt verſes, where from Chriſts Death he exhorts them to death to Sin, and a life in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but more particularly <hi>Ver.</hi> 10, 11. Likewiſe thinke ye alſo that ye are dead to Sin, but alive to God in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. So <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.4. Ye are dead to the Law by the Body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould live to another, even to him that raiſed him from the dead.] Now is not this all one, and nothing differing from the Text in hand, yet here is meant a death to Sin and the Law, and Life to God in the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From the Inſatisfactory replies of the Remonſt. who have endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Expoſition.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:45603:27"/> is a gloſſe that is not in the Text, we may alſo affirme with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Verba illa [omnes qui vivunt] poſſunt accipi ut omnes homines viventes]</hi> That is, thoſe words [Thoſe that live] may be taken for all men living.] True, and we are where we were; we grant that it was that all men living the life of Chriſt and Grace, might not live to themſelves. But this doth not yet pleaſe them, they meane all men living the life of Nature, but this is not proved; we find not that every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> is bound to live to Chriſt, or that it was his end and intention: They would faine prove it in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. To turne every one of you from your Sins; but from every one of you, meaning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> one and other, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is invalid. So that by all theſe particulars it may appeare, that by (are dead) is meant dead to Sin: And by (They that live) is meant life of Chriſt: Then how this maketh for him let any judge; and thus we may argue.</p>
               <p>That all for whom Chriſt died are dead to Sin, but every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> neither is, nor ſhall be ſo dead, therefore that All doth not take in every Son of <hi>Adam.</hi> A more cleare ſenſe of the place I ſhall beglad to receive.</p>
               <p n="7">7. [Having thus ſuffered and died for our ſinnes, he roſe againe the third day, and roſe acquitted of all the Sins imputed to him, and a Triumphant over all the Enemies of our Salvation.] That he did ſo no man denyeth, he had no Sins imputed to him, but over them he became a Victor; and this is true, though we ſay he ſuffered for the Sins of the Elect only: unleſſe he prove, that he was acquitted from the Sins of every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant over all the Enemies of the Salvation of every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is his taske to prove, and that which he holds, but this he doth not ſo much as affirme, much leſſe prove, and this is his weakeneſſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. [All this Oblation of this his Sacrifice he did dignifie through the oneneſſe of his will with his Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is more then if every man had ſuffered, and accepted of God as if all had ſuffered.] Herein we agree that it was with God as if all for whom he dyed had ſuffered; but herein ſtill is he deficient, he proves not that it was as if every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuffered: Certainly then no man ſhould ſuffer againe, for Juſtice it ſelfe requireth not a double ſuffering for the ſame Sins. So that now to reaſume theſe particulars, I ſay againe, That his being made fleſh, his comming into the world, being made in the nature of mankind, ſtanding in the roome of mankind, made under the Law, having the Sins of men imputed to him, and enduring the puniſhment that was due to them, and ſtanding acquited of them, and that in all theſe his will to be one with his Fathers, all theſe are requiſite to his procuring of life: Herein we agree, and herein the Controverſie not touched; but that any of theſe, or all of theſe were done for every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> to procure life Eternall for them, he doth not yet prove, and therefore comes ſhort of his generall Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoke of his generall Redemption, he comes to ſpeake of his ſpeciall, the particulars whereof (though lyable to exception) yet are not pertinent to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: yet ſome I ſhall inſert of greateſt concernment; He to prove the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Death of Chriſt by the Spirit of God in the hearts of men, he produceth <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. [Thou waſt ſlaine and haſt redemed us by thy Bloud out of every tongue and Nation.] Now, The Reader muſt underſtand that this Text is produced by us againſt his generall Redemption; and thus we urge, that if he redeemed them out of tongues and nations, then all were not ſo redeemed, for ſome there are &amp; muſt be out of whom
<pb facs="tcp:45603:28"/> they are ſaid to be ſo redeemed. Now upon this ground the Author cunningly ſhuffles this Text in among others, treating of the Application of Chriſts Death, that ſo it might unſuſpectedly be taken in the ſame ſenſe, but this a foule perverſion. Now that the Text ſpeaketh of the Act of Chriſt in procuring Life and Redemption, and that by bloudſhed, I am enduced to conclude from theſe grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the word in the Text, which though we read it, [Thou haſt redeemed,] which word may be diſtorted to that ſenſe; yet the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Thou haſt bought us, which word plainly relateth to the price paying, which was his Bloud as ſhed; which word I conceive cannot be produced in the whole Scripture in any other ſenſe, and is not this word preſſed by our Adverſaries in that ſenſe? in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. denying the Lord <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that bought them; but ſurely thoſe were not redeemed by Bloudſprinkling, and why they ſhould put any other ſenſe upon the word then in that place they themſelves plead for, I cannot ſee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From circumſtantiating expreſſions in the Text: as that he is ſaid to redeeme by Bloud. Now the Application of the Bloud of Chriſt to the hearts of men is done by Spirit: But between Spirit and Bloud there is a wide difference; the one is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, the other the meritorious cauſe of the Application. But he ſaith, [True it is by Bloud; but it is Bloudſprinkling;] but this gloſſe is not in the Text; and ſhould we ſay ſo he would preſently aske us what belongs to them that adde to the Scripture, but he doth not only ſay that which the Word ſaith not, but that which it explodes; As for his expreſſion [by Bloudſprinkling] it is a quite diſtinct thing from Bloud, becauſe the ſprinkling of Bloud is the Act of the Spirit; and the Text ſaith, [Thou waſt ſlaine and haſt redeemed by Bloud,] which referreth that Redemption by Bloud to his Death and Bloudſhed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Act of Application by Bloudſprinkling is ſo the Act of the Son, as that it is alſo the Act of the Father, and the holy Spirit; but that which is here ſaid [The Lambe, thou art worthy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe thou was killed and haſt redeemed us by thy Bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Cannot be ſaid of any but Chriſt, and that as by his Bloudſhed procured life for us.</p>
               <p>The Authors reply may draw more from me, but herein he ſavours ſtrong of an <hi>Arminian;</hi> thus they envade the Text, as if it ſpake o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch to whom the Bloud of Chriſt was Applyed,<note place="margin">Acta. Synod. <hi>360.</hi>
                  </note> and in whom it had its full efficacy, [<hi>Quis non videt hic agi de illis quibus non tantum impetravit, ſed per ſidem applicavit,</hi> &amp;c] But this ſolves it not; the Application is inſerted in the next verſe, but the Impetration only in the 9. verſe, which impetration did tend to a further Act.</p>
               <p>Againe, as he did ſet downe divers particulars that conduced to the effecting of the firſt, ſo he doth now ſome that conduce to this ſecond, and thus goeth on:</p>
               <p>[For effecting of which Redemption Jeſus Chriſt was exalted at his Fathers right hand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. <hi>Act</hi> 5.31.] But herein I am unſatisfied, why his exalting to his Fathers right hand is made an Act of Application, more then his Reſurrection from Death, I thinke he hath no ground to diſjoyne them, they are conjoyned by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Certainly all the Acts of his Exaltation tend the ſame way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I conceive (as I have formerly hinted) that all the Acts of Chriſt mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Tend to perfect his Impetration and procurement of Salvation; For if he had not Riſen, Aſcended, Interceded, the Purchaſe had not been made, or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation impetrated for men; though nothing elſe was to be paid as Price but Bloud; yet ſomething elſe was to be done, there was to be <hi>[Aſcenſio Sacerdotis &amp; oſtenſio
<pb facs="tcp:45603:28"/> ſanguinis,]</hi> The Prieſt was to aſcend into the veile and ſhew the Bloud, elſe no Atonement procured by the Prieſt: Therefore this is not well divided from the other in the firſt Redemption, or procuring of Salvation.</p>
               <p>And why may not he as well ſay that he dyed to effect that Redemption, as he was exalted to his Fathers right hand? For both came under the ſame Notion of effecting that Reconciliation. And the cited place <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. ſpeaketh no more then this, that he was not only to dye, but to be raiſed againe and exalted, elſe could he not as God, give them Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins. All this proveth not that his Seſſion at his Fathers right hand is an Act of Application, or tended more to it than his Death and Paſſion. As for his ſubdivided particulars in <hi>Pag</hi> 6. I grant them as being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Controverſie: untill he come in the 7. <hi>Pag.</hi> wherein he delivereth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that deſerveth examination, which is this;</p>
               <p>[In ſome ſort interceding and putting in for Tranſgreſſors, even the Sons of men, yet in, and of the world: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21.23, That ſo the men of the world might be convinced and allured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in a ſpeciall manner doth he intercede, being Advocate for his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and preſenteth them to his Father holy and ſpotleſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22.] Wherein are ſublime diſcoveries worth our notice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas he ſaith, [Puting in for Tranſgreſſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in a ſpeciall manner interceding for his choſen ones,] ſeemes to intimate that [Tranſgreſſors] and [choſen ones] are not coincident; which is not only contrary to the truth, but himſelfe, in <hi>Pag.</hi> 120. And what ſpeciall favour interceded for, or manner of interceding that he doth not uſe for Tranſgreſſors? This is a nicity beyond my reaſon, and I feare his owne too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why ſhould Interceſſion be ſo ranged as to make a part of his Application? He ſeemeth to be touched with <hi>Arminius</hi> his Magneticke, who ſaith, <hi>Sacrificatio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet ad meritum, interceſſio ad applicationem, meritum acquiſivit ſacrificio, pro appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione intercedit. In Perk</hi> 70. But it is againſt reaſon, for if he Intercede it muſt be with God, and for men; And doth not Reaſon and his owne Principles tell us that this muſt appertaine to his Impetration? Nay, doth not he ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. [By this he procureth the grant of Diſpenſation?] And why ſhould that which the Author pleades Is (for all) be produced as an ingredient into that Redemption which is proper only to Beleevers?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I demand one place or places of Scripture, that hold forth the diſtinction of generall and ſpeciall Interceſſion, eſpecially now he is at his Fathers right hand, for ſo he urgeth both kinds, nay at any time, this is a ſtreame from the <hi>Arminian</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but not from the Sacred Fountaine of Gods word, thoſe Texts alleadged come ſhort as not proving that he Interceded for all and every Tranſgreſſor, or Crucifier.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why doth he Connexe [Allure] and [Convince?] As if alwaies and whom God intendeth to convince he intendeth to allure: The World (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21.23.) he would have convinced, that Chriſt was the true Meſſiah: but that he would have them allured to come to him is a preſuming on the Text to affirme. The Devills beleeve that, and are convinced; <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.11. But he never intended to allure them: Many ſouls are not convinced that Jehovah is God till and by their deſtruction, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 83. laſt. But then I cannot think that God allures them; Many are not convinced that Chriſt was ſent till hell ſeaze on them, and then they ſhall [every Tongue confeſſe]
<pb facs="tcp:45603:29"/> but then God intendeth not to allure them, it is too late; and therefore though we grant that Chriſt prayed for his, that the world might be convinced, yet it will not follow that he prayed that they might be allured: And for his generall Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for all, ſeeing ſo many Texts confine his Interceſſion to Beleevers, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Maketh Interceſſion for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. Makes interceſſion for them that come to God by him, <hi>Heb</hi> 6.20. He entered into the heavens for us, <hi>viz.</hi> Heires of Promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. Who appeareth in heaven for us. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. We have an Advocate with the Father: And by our Author <hi>Pag.</hi> 54. it is urged as a privilege of Beleevers; and not one place in the whole Scripture that maketh out a generall Interceſſion, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but judge it an Oracle of fleſh and bloud, and not of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I would know a ground why he changeth the termes? When he ſpeaketh of the generall, and for Tranſgreſſors, he giveth it the name of Interceſſion only: But when he ſpeaketh of the ſpeciall, for his Choſen Ones, he giveth the title of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, as the Reader may obſerve: As if there was ſome momentous difference betwixt an Interceſſour and an Advocate, which the Scripture affordeth not, for that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Maketh Interceſſion for us; And that 1 <hi>Job</hi> 21.

That he intercedes in heaven for all, and yet preſents but ſome holy to his Father, is the Language only of our Author, not of Scripture, and when theſe particulars are duly ſcanned, his ſimple jumbling and confounding Notions, beyond either his owne underſtanding, or any mans elſe, will clearely appeare: From which jumbling and confuſed Diſcourſe he comes to raiſe a double Salvation; and he thus ſpeaketh;</p>

Then it ſeemeth he intendeth Grace and Faith to belong to the common, not ſpeciall Salvation, which is contrary to himſelfe in many Pages of his Diſcourſe: But if by it he meane Grace and Glory, Faith, and the Inheritance, then doth he ſpeake of Faith and beleeving as not being an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Salvation, as <hi>Pag.</hi> 10.

               <p>[The one Chriſt worketh for all men, <hi>Pag.</hi> 9.

Is it not beſtowed on men?

And acted upon men? Have they them not? Why then are they ſet downe as only wrought out for men? Certainely herein he could not promiſe himſelfe ſatisfaction. And ſo for the ſpeciall Salvation wrought
<pb facs="tcp:45603:29"/> in the hearts of men by his Spirit, why doth he ſay it was only wrought in men? Was it not alſo wrought for men by his Bloud, before it was wrought in men by his Spirit? I thinke the purchaſe of Chriſt is the foundation of every ſpirituall good whether Grace or Glory, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. His expreſſes herein therefore are prepoſterous, but herein is his miſtake, he ſhould have made his diſtinction run betweene the Acts of Chriſt in procuring and applying; but he ſpeaketh of a diſtinct good beſtowed ſome to all, ſome not to all, which is not only uſeleſſe in this Controverſie, but alſo admits not of his Expreſſions: Seeing thoſe things which are ſpeciall are wrought out for thoſe that have them, and thoſe that are common are not only wrought for, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on men.</p>
               <p>But he inſerteth ſeverall particulars as branches of this common Salvation, Which I ſhall examine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. [The earth and Inhabitants thereof which by Sin are diſſolved he beareth up the pillers of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. And the frame of the Creatures for mans uſe preſerved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.8, 9. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.45. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. And this a witneſſe of his goodneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. &amp; 17.24.31.] That the Fabricke of the world, and the Creatures thereof (by ſinne forfeited) are againe reſtored and ſuſtained, and continued for mans uſe, and that by vertue of Chriſts Sacrifice and interpoſall, I verily beleeve, and needs it muſt ſo be, man being upheld in his being, the Creatures muſt be ſo for his ſubſiſtence: and that man is ſo, is cleare, and muſt be ſo (if for no other end, yet) for this, that his Elect might come to have a being, and ſo come to Repentance: Thus far I have formerly granted, and grant this generall Salvation; And this is the <hi>Hellena</hi> on which he ſeemeth ſo enamoured, but it ſerves him not, it is nothing to the Queſtion, this he might do and yet have no thoughts to bring moſt men to Grace or Glory.</p>
               <p>But if I had an inclination to deny it, his quoted Texts prove it not, there is not any one of thoſe places alleaged, except <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. that hath any ſhew of proving that Chriſt as Mediatour procured the being of the world, and the Creatures therein; few of them ſpeake of Chriſt, but God eſſentially, the living God, Creatour of all things, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.8.9. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.45. Nay with expreſſe diſtinction from Chriſt, God man, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24.31. The reſt of Chriſt as God, and as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Preſerver of all things, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.

                  </gap>oint in hand: He may be patient and long-ſuffering to all, and yet not intend the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all to whom he is ſo patient, neither is God patient to every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> to leade them to Repentance: Could he prove that God or Chriſt intended the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of every man, <hi>I</hi> would confeſſe and prove too that he intended the eternall Salvation of every man; For Repentance of any is not willed but as meanes to that end, and it is conſidered as meanes in tendency to the end: But the former he
<pb facs="tcp:45603:30"/> proveth not, as for that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. It ſpeaketh of another patience then what every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> partaketh of, <hi>viz.</hi> the patient waiting of God in the Goſpells Miniſtry, or ſuch a deferring of Judgement, as hath the Goſpell annexed, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the whole Chapter, but ſuch an one every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> hath not enjoyed: Beſides this patience and long ſuffering of God leadeth to Repentance; that <hi>Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> not <hi>phyſice,</hi> by ſwaſion not efficiency worketh not Repentance, but admoniſheth to Repentance; and ſo this place is expounded <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. Now he admoniſheth every man to Repent, which ſheweth that the patience of God without the Word is no fit meanes to bring men to Repentance: Now this place which denoteth ſuch a longſuffering that every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> hath not, is not well produced to prove ſuch a worke, as is common for every Son of <hi>Adam;</hi> and that God intendeth by his patience to bring every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> to Repentance, it is not eaſie to grant, and as hard for the Author to prove.</p>
               <p n="3">3. [By him is procured ſome meanes, with ſome light, therein, and according thereto, to lead men to Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though to ſome more darke, ſome more clearely.] Firſt, to remove ſuch generalities and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Expreſſions fit only to deceive; then his Expreſſes will the better appeare: That Chriſt did procure meanes, and Light, and Spirit, to lead men to Repentance whoever yet denied? This commeth too ſhort of his Doctrine, for that he procured meanes to bring every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> to Repentance, this neither he nor any elſe hath yet proved; That he procured meanes, and God gives ſuch meanes to every man whereby they may know ſomething of God I grant; but that he giveth to every one ſo much as leadeth them to Repentance, this is doubtfull, every meaſure of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God ſerves not for this buſineſſe: I would know what he thinketh of thoſe that have only <hi>Verbum rei,</hi> the Book of the Creatures to read on? True, They may know ſomething of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. As his Power, and Godhead; yea, ſo much ſeene of him (the Text ſaith not as to bring them to Repentance, but) as may leave them without excuſe; and that (not for not Repenting, but) for their Idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſo much ſeene in the Creatures as may convince men of the Deity of God, that he is not made with hands, nor any ſuch Creature as they worſhipped, <hi>Ver.</hi> 23. But how will he prove hence that the Creatures are fit meanes to bring men to Repentance? To bring men to Repentance there muſt concurre theſe things; A fight of Sin to be Sin, A ſenſe of our condition without it, A Hell to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright, with other things; but which of theſe are obnoxius to them that have but the light of Nature only? For the knowledge of Sin to be Sin, the Booke of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures diſcovers not: St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I had not known ſin, but by the Law, Rom.</hi> 7.7. And that not the Law of Nature, or any thing written only in Nature, but <hi>lex ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addita,</hi> A Law that was not alwaies knowne, that ſaid (Thou ſhalt not luſt,) Beſides that men repent, it is requiſite that men ſhould know it is a duty to Repent; For that which diſcovereth not that, cannot be ſaid any way to lead to Repentance: But doth the Creature or the light of Nature command this? The time before the Goſpell commeth admoniſhing to Repent, is a time of ignorance of that duty, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. Againe, it is requiſite that men know the danger of not repenting, the puniſhment due to Sin, that ſhew men the neceſſity of repenting: But how doth the Creatures dictate any ſuch thing? Therefore that which diſcovereth not Sin to be Sin, nor it to be our duty to repent, nor the danger of not repenting, or the benefit of repenting; ſuch a thing is not a fit meanes to leade us to Repentance. But at the end of this his Aſſertion I find ſome Scriptures annexed, I ſhall perpend them to ſee if they affirme
<pb facs="tcp:45603:30"/> any ſuch thing, as that God giveth to every man ſuch means as may, and to that end to lead them to Repentance.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. Becauſe that which may be knowne of God is manifeſt in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And what is there in that Text but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſomething of God is ſeene in the Creatures, as his Power and Godhead? which might keep them from Idolatry, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of ſuch things as they did worſhip, but not ſo much as to bring them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for that Idolatry, the Text ſaith no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Acts</hi> 17.24, 30. Now he admoniſheth all men every where to repent.] This is the ſame nature with the former; It is ſpoken of thoſe, and to thoſe that worſhiped the unknown God; as <hi>Ver.</hi> 23. To which he addeth theſe words, and tells them that God Created the Worlds, and placed the bounds of our Habitations, as <hi>Ver.</hi> 24, 25, 26. and this <gap reason="foreign">

That they might enquire after the Lord to know ſo much of him as to convince them that the Godhead is not like to Silver or Gold, or the worke of mans hands, as <hi>ver.</hi> 29. But that it was for ſuch an end as to bring them to Repentance, the Text owneth not, nay it altogether diſclaimes; as <hi>Ve.</hi> 30. (The time of this ignorance God regarded not,) as if he ſhould have ſaid, when there is only the Creatures and light of Nature in regard of the duty of Repentance, it could be no other but the time of Ignorance, ſeeing that by that light they neither knew that they ſhould, nor how they ſhould Repent. But now he admoniſheth all to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, no ſuch admonition by the Creatures, then had his words (But now he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth) beene to no purpoſe: Therefore his joyning 24. and 30. <hi>verſes</hi> together, as if he intended to prove that by the Creatures God intended to lead men to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is very weake and frivolous.</p>
               <p>Now if he ſhall reply, that <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. ſaith, The Gentiles did the things contained in the Law and that by nature; and therefore why not Repent? I anſwer, Let the Text be well weighed and we ſhall ſee a difference betwixt <hi>(Legem implere,)</hi> and <hi>(Ea quae legis ſunt facere,)</hi> to do things that the Law commands, and to fulfill the Law. The ſecond requires that what is done, be done out of obedience to a knowne Law, the other not: The Gentiles might do ſomething that the Law commanded, as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, Plutarch,</hi> who gave good rules of life, but not out of obedience to any Law of God; but was it otherwiſe, though the Law of Nature taught what to do, yet it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not Repentance for not doing of it, becauſe the firſt Law of God admitteth it not; He commanded to do or elſe adjudged to ſuffer the Curſe. To come to happineſſe by Faith and Repentance is a ſecret of the Goſpell, which all the light of Nature is never able to diſcover, nor the ſeverity of the Law did ever admit.</p>

Where was the ſtop in the former, that they had not an encreaſe of Light and Grace? And where was the improvement in the other, that deſerved a new ſupply of Grace in Converſion? And as for theſe Texts cited, they prove but this, that God ſometimes rewardeth an improvement of Evangelicall Grace with more Grace: But they prove not that is Gods unbended Method in giving or denying Grace; neither is this any thing to this purpoſe, to prove Chriſt procuring Life and Salvation for every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe every man hath not that upon the improvement of which he promiſeth more Grace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. [Yea, with ſome, where the Goſpell comes, he goeth further, ſo enlightening them to underſtand the report of the Goſpell that they do beleeve.] That he doth ſo is a truth, but why inſerted I ſee not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hath he to ſoone forgotten that the thing which he purſues is ſuch as is done for all, and to cleare it, he giveth us a taſte of that which he ſaith expreſly he giveth but to ſome; this cannot be pertinent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He here ſuppoſeth that the Goſpell is but diſpenſed to ſome, which is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious Aſſertion to his former, <hi>viz.</hi> That God by the Goſpell calleth every Sonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> one time or other, in ſome degree or other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas he ſpeaketh of a (further illumination,) either he meaneth of ſuch as have uſed their firſt meanes well, or with ſuch as doe not; if the former, then this is nothing different from the former, <hi>viz.</hi> [If they abide in his call they ſhall know the truth,] and therefore deſerved not to be ranged as a new particular: If he meane the ſecond; then that Method of God for prounded in diſpenſing Grace is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed; Therefore this muſt either be (at leaſt) a Tautology, or a contradiction to his firſt particular.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hath he ſo ſoone forgotten, that the thing which he is to prove, is the procuring and working out with God for men? And he here produceth an Actuall beſtowing and applying of the Bloud of Chriſt, if to the enlightned and brought in to beleeve, be to have the Bloud of Chriſt applyed? All that might be ſaid may not, I may not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him ſo farre in his extravagancies as I might, ſufficient is it to take notice that this is not oppoſite to his purpoſe, it being done only for ſome, and not for all and every Son of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may reaſume the whole number of his particulars, and ſtand to wonder what light they bring to this Point, or what he helpeth mean underſtandings in theſe darke Controverſies by the perſpicuity of his Method and order: That we may review them alitle joyntly, that which he is to illuſtrate to them is the common Salvation, which is Chriſts working out with God for men Remiſſion, and Eternall Salvation, and ſuch as is done for all, and as it is a working out for men, diſtinct from working in and upon men: His firſt and his laſt particulars are not oppoſite, becauſe they are ſuch as are effected on, and in men, as it is to be for all men. So all the reſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate particulars are not oppoſite, ſeeing they are not, nor by him proved to be procured, or to be diſpenſed to all and every man; take them alltogether, and what do they cleare? What do they prove? Nothing certainly, and ſerve for nothing, but deceive and confound his Readers: and thus I conclude, Let him numerate never ſo many particulars procured for, or beſtowed on men, if they be not ſuch as are meanes in Gods ſeries of Diſpenſing Eternall Life, I ſhall not contend, but paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:45603:32"/> them by, as not pertinent to the Queſtion, and leave them to him as not only procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, but actually conferred upon men, but if he produce any ſuch things as are the meanes to bring us to life, as Grace, Supernaturall light, the call of the Goſpell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I deny that ſuch things are either procured for, or beſtowed upon every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> which he often affirmeth, but never yet proved.</p>
               <p>Having thus immethodically propounded and diſplayed the particulars of his Common Salvation, he proceeds thus to affirme.</p>
               <p>[In ſome ſenſe, and in truth all may be ſaid to be Reconciled, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, Saved, yea Juſtified, in him, though moſt be deſtitute of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of theſe.] Which is as much as to ſay, Thoſe may truly be ſaid to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that neither are, nor ſhall be reconciled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed, I find ſometimes that God calleth things that are not as if they were. <hi>Rom</hi> 4 17. And Faith hath this privilege, to ſee at a diſtance things that are not as if they were; but then let us conſider what they are, not meerely poſſible but future, ſuch as God by his power can, and his unbended purpoſe hath determined, and his faithfull Promiſes hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us ſhall come to paſſe; for ſuch things to appeare to God, or a faithfull eye, as if they were, is no ſtrange thing: But for ſuch things as are never to come to reality, no nor ever was ſo intended, as the Reconciliation, Juſtification, and Salvation of many were not intended by Chriſt in his Death, as the Remonſt. ſay; and for ſuch as neither are, nor ſhall be effected, for ſuch to be called as done, and to ſay that ſuch men are Reconciled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which neither are ſo, nor ſhall be ſo in time, ſeemes to me an incredible abſurdity. But he will happily ſay, They may be ſaid to be ſo, becauſe they may be ſo: They are under ſuch conditions which if they performe, God is ready to do all thoſe. Well, be it ſo: Why then ſhould they rather be ſaid Saved, then dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, till the condition be performed: I hope the way is indifferent to Damnation as Salvation, as the Parties beleeve or not beleeve, for the Goſpell ſaith beleeve and be ſaved, and alſo beleeve not and be damned, and men may accidentally contract a ſorer Condemnation if they beleeve not; Therfore why they ſhould rather be ſaid to be reconciled and ſaved, becauſe they may be ſaved by Faith, then that they are damned becauſe they may be damned by unbeleefe: Nay, why may not men conclude ſooner that they are not reconciled and redeemed, (eſpecially caſting an impartiall eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves) ſeeing they find themſelves more prone to reject him then to receive him: to ſtand out then to beleeve in him, I ſee not.</p>
               <p>Againe, It is not ſutable to denominate them Juſtified and Reconciled that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are nor ſhall be endued with Faith: And why may not men be as well ſaid to be Glorified in Chriſt, as Juſtified and Reconciled: Yet it is no ſober expreſſion to ſay that every man, yea, the damned Spirits are glorified in Chriſt; Certainely the Scripture calleth none Reconciled, Juſtified, Redeemed, Saved, but ſuch as are ſo, or ſhall in Gods time be ſo,</p>
               <p>But againe, how he can thus conclude for every man from the Premiſes I ſee not: He produceth not one particular which he can prove to be common to every Son of <hi>Adam;</hi> but the firſt <hi>viz.</hi> an upholding in their being, both man, and the world of Creatures; But are all ſaid to be Reconciled, Redeemed, Saved, Juſtified, becauſe they have their being continued, and the world of Creatures alſo for their uſe? Certainely, there is no neceſſary dependance, or becauſe ſome are made partakers of Supernaturall light, the Goſpell, and an encreaſe of light, are all and every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid thereby to be Juſtified, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> But he attempts to backe it both by Scripture and Reaſon, I ſhall examine both: His Scriptures are two.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45603:33"/>
               <p>[<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24.] Herein I need not call out the diſquiſition of more piercing eyes to ſearch out his fallacy, but any common capacity to explode his palpable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity; doth the Text ſpeake of a Potentiall Juſtification, wherewith all may be ſaid Juſtified, and yet all miſſe of it, and yet be juſtified? The Text ſpeakes of a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith, which is an Actuall Juſtification, and there is none ſo juſtified but they partake of it. If the Text had favoured him it ſhould have run thus, [The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God for all with God.] But it ſaith, The righteouſneſſe of God unto all and upon all. Againe, the Text ſaith, It is unto and upon all: But doth the Text meane All and every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> whether beleeving, or not beleeving? Let him view the Text: That Juſtification by which every man is ſaid juſtified, is ſuch as is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith; But the Text owneth none ſuch, it ſaith upon all them that beleeve; that is the Circumciſion and uncircumciſion, Jew and Gentile, as <hi>ver.</hi> 30. there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but the beleeving Gentile as well as the beleeving Jew is juſtified freely: This the Remonſt. acknowledge with the Scripture, <hi>Nullus niſi fidelis &amp; quâ fidelis eſt juſtificatur, ſive à condemnatione abſolvitur. Ant.</hi> 87. Strange it is to me that the Authour ſhould dreame that this Text ſhould call every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> juſtified.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14.18.] As for the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> I cannot apprehend any ſhew of Reaſon, the dint is in the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> where the Text ſaith, [By the juſtifying of one the benefit aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards all to juſtification of life.] But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Here we ſee not any ſhew of reaſon to ſay that all are juſtified: The Text (from any thing that Chriſt did) doth not ſay every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> may be called ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: where is there any ſuch word?</p>
               <p n="2">2. This place ſpeakes not of any potentiall juſtification, by which thoſe may be ſaid juſtified that Actually are not ſo; but is an Actuall Juſtification, and that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to an Actuall Condemnation, and expounded in the 19. <hi>ver.</hi> by being made righteous, and that as in <hi>Adam</hi> were made ſinners: that Juſtification which he is to prove hence, is ſuch as is appropriated to them that are not, nor ever ſhall be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But let him ſhew and prove where any word in that Chapter ſeconds ſuch an one as that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Text ſaith indeed, [Free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.] But what is that (All?) To be taken with, or without a limitation? Let us compare the Apoſtle with himſelfe; The buſineſſe of Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, is a thing that the Apoſtle takes often occaſion to treate of in this Epiſtle; yea, it is his maine drift in this former part of his Epiſtle, and this he had ſaid before was upon all, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.22. but it was upon all that beleeve, and that the Promiſe thereof might be made ſure to an All, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.16. But it was ſure to all the ſeed, and when he ſpeaketh of the ſame thing in the ſame Epiſtle, that it is upon (all men) why ſhould we take him in any other ſenſe then he explaineth himſelfe about the ſame buſineſſe? Even they ſeeme to be ſpoken with the ſame breath; and ſo no other ſenſe to be given to this place but this, (upon all men,) that is, on all them that beleeve; and that as the Condemnation came on all them that come from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo the righteouſneſſe of one came on all men that come from him, and here lyeth the perfect Analogie betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Adam;</hi> and this will more appeare if we well conſider the Text: That Redemption and Juſtification which he gives to every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> is ſuch as only is wrought out for men, but not on men, for this is to partake of Actuall Juſtification; but of this latter the Text ſpeakes, it ſaith, [It commeth on all men] but Juſtification is upon none but Beleevers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24. Againe this Righteouſneſſe is ſaid to come upon all, as the Condemnation came upon all by <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, but Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came Actually upon all, ſo that they were without a Saviour, in an infallibility of
<pb facs="tcp:45603:33"/> periſhing. So this comming of Righteouſneſſe on all muſt be Actuall too, and ſo as all on whom it ſo commeth ſhall infallibly come to glory and life Eternall, but ſo Righteouſneſſe commeth not on every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> but Beleevers only. Againe, This (All men) in <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. is ſupplied and expounded <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. by thoſe that receive abundance of Grace, and the gift of Righteouſneſſe, which maketh it appeare that is an Actuall Juſtification which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of here, and therefore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth not ſuch an one, which may be though none partake of Juſtification; and ſuch an one as none can be truly ſaid to be juſtified with, but thoſe that Beleeve, therefore owneth not ſuch an one as is competible to every Son of <hi>Adam;</hi> So that the validity of his Scriptures I ſee not, I ſhall examine his Reaſon.</p>
               <p>[It may be underſtood and beleeved as well as this, that all men were made righteous in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and were truly righteous in him, of which Righteouſneſſe none ever yet felt or partaked, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. And ſo though all recovered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] The Queſtion is not how it may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and underſtood if it was ſo in truth, but whether it be ſo or no.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may grant the whole, both may be underſtood alike, that is neither of them at all. I know no Scripture that ſaith all the Sons and Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> were made righteous. That Text <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. faith no more but that man was made righteous, which is true in that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> were ſo, Not that every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> was made holy; none were made holy but thoſe that were Created, but his Poſterity were not created; holineſſe was not derived to any by propagation. A ground why every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> is not ſaid in Scripture to be righteous in <hi>Adam,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is this, to be made righteous as <hi>Adam</hi> was, is a reall denomination and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty induced into the Patient, and that by a tranſient Action, paſſing from the Agent into the Patient, but ſuch an Action there cannot be <hi>[In ſubjecto nondum exiſtente]</hi> In a Subject that hath not actuall exiſtence; So that our Author muſt cleare this to us before he can make it the ſtandard of our beliefe of the former, that every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> is Reconciled and Juſtified in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall grant him that all are, or were made righteous in <hi>Adam;</hi> yet I cannot ſubſcribe to the other, neither is it any way explicatory of this, that All <hi>Adams</hi> Sons are made alive and juſtified in Chriſt; for let us conſider, there were none made righteous (or could be ſo ſaid) but thoſe that were to come from him by propagation (and under that notion as comming from him) he was made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and betruſted with Grace as a publique Perſon to convey to his Poſterity and ſuch as came from him, ſo that all that come from him, his off-ſpring, we ſhal grant for Conference ſake that they were made righteous in him: Now will this inferre or help us to underſtand that all were juſtified in Chriſt? It helps us to beleeve that all that do, or are to come from him were made righteous in him, but no further; for what ground can be deduced from Scripture or Reaſon, that (as <hi>Adams</hi> Figure) Chriſt makes more righteous in him, then come from him to have a being from, and in him? let us grant him that all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> were made righteous in him, becauſe they were to come from him; yet we cannot yet yeeld or underſtand that every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> is juſtified in Chriſt, becauſe they have not, nor ever are to have a being from him. Having laid down his reaſon, he produces a diſſimilitude betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; Chriſt, thus.</p>
               <p>[As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> being a living Soule and of the earth, He loſt all our ſoules in his Fall, without remedy on his part: So the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quickening Spirit, the Lord from heaven, and loſeth none, but who
<pb facs="tcp:45603:34"/> ever now periſheth, deſtroyeth himſelfe, and loſeth his owne ſoule.] The abſurdities and obſcurity of theſe expreſſes far exceed the pertinency or uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Point in hand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Author pretendeth a diſſimilitude, but yet he brings an (As,) (So,) As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt: So the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> loſeth none. Now there is none but knoweth that theſe words (As,) (So,) ſet forth a ſimilitude, as the Apoſtle when he would ſhew a Similitude betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19, 21. he ſaith, As by offence of one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Righteouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when he ſheweth a diſſimilitude, he uſeth other expreſſions, as (For,) (But,) as <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. For the judgement was by one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the free gift is of many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we may expect no better from the Author, but this <hi>Obiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, The Scripture ſheweth that diſſimilitude, but he ſheweth not where. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who undertaketh the buſineſſe of the difference and ſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. yet this he mentioneth not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Phraſe [Loſeth none,] is very fallacious and doubtfully laid downe, it may be taken either Actively or Paſſively, Actively to caſt away or to deſtroy; ſo it is taken when he ſaith <hi>Adam</hi> loſt himſelfe and us all; if he thus take it then Scripture neither doth nor can, ſet downe ſuch a difference, <hi>Adam</hi> deſtroyed, but Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth none: differences are <hi>(Inter Entia)</hi> poſitive beings do uſually afford diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; and we ſhall find that when the Apoſtles ſhew diſcrepances betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, they give them ſtill betwixt <hi>Adams</hi> loſing, and Chriſts ſaving, not <hi>Adams</hi> loſing, and Chriſts not loſing, this would import that Chriſts Office was only not to deſtroy. Againe ſecondly, It may be taken Paſſively, that is, He ſuffers none to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and thus is it taken when Chriſt is ſaid not to loſe; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. &amp; 18.9. So Chriſts not loſing is nothing but his not ſuffering to periſh, if it be thus taken, then the diſſimilitude muſt run thus, As <hi>Adam</hi> loſt all, ſo Chriſt recovers all: And as all were loſt by <hi>Adam</hi> without remedy, ſo Chriſt recovered all infallibly, and without feare of being taken out of his hands, he ſhall ſuffer none to be loſt, no not to loſe themſelves, (for then are they loſt) and therefore he removes all externall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall principles that might deſtroy us. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28, 29. Now if this be his diſſimilitude the Scripture no where owneth it; Indeed we read that Chriſt loſeth none of them whom his Father giveth to him, or thoſe who come to him, but that he ſuffered none to periſh I read not: So that if by (Chriſt loſeth none) he meaneth that Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth none, it is in vaine produced Againſt them that grant that he came not to condemne the world but to ſave; But it by it he meane that Chriſt ſuffers none to periſh, or hath done what in him lyeth to ſave every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> this he muſt prove. That after plea (Whoever periſheth deſtroyeth his owne ſelfe) ſeemes to appeare under the face of an Argument to prove that Chriſt hath done what in him lyeth to ſave every man, but it is not valid, for men may deſtroy themſelves and yet Chriſt ſuffer them to periſh, and if he ſuffer them to periſh, he doth not what in him lyeth to ſave them; We might deſtroy our ſelves though Chriſt doe nothing for us, nay, our deſtroying of our Soules was the occaſion of Chriſts comming to ſave us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtroying of our Soules hath no dependance of Chriſts ſaving of us.</p>
               <p>Having thus vented his Paradox, and as he thinketh, backed it, be comes to reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his former poſition, which ſeemes to be the reſult of his mind and thoughts, thus.</p>
               <p>[He hath ſo ſaved all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he makes all ſalvable, ſo as there is a poſſibility in, and through, and with Chriſt, for all men to come in into him, to beleeve on him, and be eternally ſaved in beleeving.]
<pb facs="tcp:45603:34"/> He hath not produced any thing as done for all, and proved it alſo to have been done for, or to all, that may bring every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> under a poſſibility of beleeving, and ſo of being ſaved: This I ſee is that on which many ſeeme to dote, therefore I ſhall a little expatiate my ſelfe herein; Firſt, I muſt remove all Equivocation, when he ſaith [poſſibility] he meaneth, I hope, only a poſſibility, for otherwiſe we may ſay that Chriſt intended to make Salvation poſſible, that is, in making of Salvation cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he made it poſſible, certainty including a poſſibility, but not <hi>è contra.</hi> But his expreſſes herein ſeeme to averre, that the chiefe and firſt end of the Death of Chriſt (ſo farre as it reſpected man) was that he might make the Salvation of man poſſible, nothing different from the reſult of Arminian exercitations, wherein we ſhall find thus, <hi>[Chriſtus impetravit ut Deus poſſit &amp; velit communicare ſua beneficia,</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. If he propounded to himſelfe only a poſſibility of Salvation, then though none be ſaved, yet Chriſt hath the end and travell of his ſoule; for though none be ſaved or beleeve actually, yet the poſſibility remaineth entire,<note place="margin">Acta. Synod. <hi>285.</hi>
                  </note> and this will be found the ſowreſt peeces of Arminianiſme: Thus they ſay, [<hi>Impetratio ſarta tecta manet perfecta ſuis numeris conſtat etſi omnes maneant increduli,</hi> &amp;c.] But how harſh this may be to any Chriſtian Eare, let any Reader judge, and I wiſh the Author be not driven to ſay that Chriſt in being Lord of all (which may be without the Salvation of any,) he ſeeth the travell of his Soule, as he ſeemeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 142.

To this I anſwer, In that he could by his power, he could his juſtice notwithſtanding; for God cannot by his abſolute power do any thing againſt his Juſtice, no more then he can ſin or deny himſelfe; or ceaſe to be God, this
<pb facs="tcp:45603:35"/> would be impotency, not Omnipotency. Therefore in ſaying he can do it, we <hi>(In eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem inſtanti rationis,)</hi> affirme he can do it his juſtice notwithſtanding, and this followes upon the principles of <hi>Arminius,</hi>

                  <hi>[Ex hoc antecedente Deus hoc fecit, ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur neceſſario ergo juste,]</hi> If God do it, it is enough to conclude it juſt. Againe, It may be ſaid that Chriſt did not procure a power to ſave, but a poſſibility to will to ſave, as <hi>Corvinus</hi> inſerteth, <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t poſſet peccatorem velle ſalvare ſalva juſtitia,]</hi> That he might will to ſave, and yet his Juſtice ſafe. To this I anſwer, If he had a power to ſave, he had a power to will to ſave without Chriſt, for he cannot do any thing that he cannot will; and this is true in <hi>Arminius</hi> Reaſon, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aum includic alterum, nemo poteſt credere, niſi poteſt velle credere, quia nemo credit nolens. In Perkin.</hi> 592. So I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, <hi>Deus non poteſt ſalvare niſi poſſit velle ſalvare, quia Deus nominem ſalvat nolens.</hi> And if he can will to ſave us without Chriſt, then he can will to ſave without Chriſt, <hi>Salva juſtitia,</hi> otherwiſe he cannot will it, he cannot will to do any thing injuſtly. And that he had a poſſibility to ſave, and to will to ſave without Chriſts Death, and that his Juſtice ſafe, to me ſeemeth evident, becauſe neither a poſſibility to ſave, nor a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to will to ſave, no nor a will to ſave, is againſt the Juſtice of God; this I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to let the Author ſee, that ſeing God had a poſſibility to ſave Sinners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, &amp; their Salvation was poſſible before, and without Chriſts Death; then to let him conſider how derogatory to Chriſts wiſdome it is to ſay that his end in dying was to make the Salvation of man poſſible, I cannot conceive that he would ſhed his bloud to procure that which was in being before, and without his Death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For his expreſſions aſſociated with this, <hi>viz.</hi> [A poſſibleneſſe of mens comming in to Chriſt and beleeving.] It is a farre different thing from the former; when our Salvation is ſaid to be poſſible, we meane in regard of God, that God can bring us to Salvation: but when our faith is ſaid to be poſſible, it may be referred either to God or man: That God can by abſolute power bring men in to beleeve, or elſe that we have a power to come in or beleeve, what he meaneth is very dubious: The ground of coupelling theſe together is yet obſcure, for our Salvation eternall may be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet faith not poſſible, for God can bring us to Salvation without Faith if he pleaſe; and if by the poſſibility of our beleeving he meane only a power in God to bring all men in to beleeve, I grant there is ſuch a poſſibility, as there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite of more worlds being created, but then this is too rude and indetermined to make either the end or effect of Chriſts Death.</p>
               <p>Neither is it cleare that Chriſt prepared a poſſibility on mans part to beleeue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not procure that all ſhould enjoy the Goſpell without which men cannot beleeve. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15. A poſſibility to beleeve is too unworthy a thing for Chriſt to purchaſe at ſo deare a rate: Chriſt purchaſed Grace, not Nature, for us, but <hi>Poſſe credere eſt naturae,</hi> A poſſibility to beleeve, is a Priviledge of Nature, not Grace. I deſire a more cleare explication of himſelfe, then ſhall he have a more perſpicuous Anſwer.</p>
               <p>He having ſummed up the particulars of this common Salvation, (but weakely ſeeing they cannot be proved to be the ſhare of every Son of <hi>Adam</hi>) he comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his ſpeciall, what he doth for Beleevers, and that in <hi>Pag.</hi> 11, 12, 13. with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall unjuſtifiable expreſſions, which becauſe they are not pertinent to the Queſtion I wave them till he come in the 14 <hi>Page</hi> to give us a <hi>Summ. total.</hi> and entire reſult of this elaborate Chapter thus.</p>
               <p>[Now betweene theſe two Salvations, that with God for men, and that in men to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Scripture doth often and many waies diſtinguiſh.]</p>

               <p>Behold the iſſue of this fruitleſſe peece, hath he been in ſo long a travell of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and hath brought forth nothing but what every man grants? Let me againe interrogate, where doth he find it denyed that the purchaſing and applying, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing for, and beſtowing upon men any good, are two diſtinct Acts? Nay, What Treatiſe findeth he, where it is not ſtrongly aſſerted? and therefore he needed not to have been at ſo much paines to prove it; But by this foundation we may gueſſe what ſtructure we ſhall find. But yet the manner of their diſtinction, as he layeth it down, is ſomething obſervable, and ſuch as we find no where elſe, as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. [The former is called a reconciliation by his Death, the other a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by his life. <hi>Ro.</hi> 5.10.] that his procuring reconciliation by his death, ſhould be here ſet downe under being reconciled by his Death, is ſomething diſtorted and improbable; Doth the Author conceive that thoſe words do not denote actuall Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation? If they do, (as it is cleare they do) then this is the ſecond Act, not the firſt, only Application, not procurement of it; The Text ſaith not, If he merited Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for us, much more ſhall we be ſaved by his life, If the Text had favoured this conceit, it would have run thus: If he hath procured Reconciliation by his Death, then ſhall we be actually reconciled by his life, but it runs not thus; the inference is not from Impetration to Application, but from Reconciliation to Salvation, two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct degrees of good applyed, the Scripture yields no ſuch difference, becauſe both Impetration, and Application of all good, is ſaid to be by his Death, and by his Bloud.</p>
               <p n="2">2. [The former was a Reconciliation wrought for the world by God in Chriſt: The latter a Reconciliation of ſome to God by Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19.] Herein lyeth a twofold difference couched, but both abſurd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith, The one is (For men,) the other (In men:) But this is no difference, for herein they both agree; The ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the Application is wrought out for men, as to inſtance, the Grace and Faith that is given to ſome by which they are overcome, is alſo wrought for, elſe how comes it to be applyed, or how can it be called the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Sprinkling of Chriſt, if the Bloud of Chriſt did not procure the Application?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, The former is wrought by God, the latter by Jeſus Chriſt; As if he ſhould ſay, the Impetration or procurement was done by God, the Application was done by Jeſus Chriſt; which foppery diſcovers it ſelfe ſufficiently, the contrary of is moſt true, the Impetration is Chriſts Act, the Application is Gods, if this be true <hi>[Chriſtus Impetravit ut Deus poſſit, &amp;c]</hi> And herein is one difference, the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is the Act of Chriſt as of one that dyed, the Application is Gods the offended Party.</p>
               <p n="3">3. [In effecting the former he came from the Father, for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the other, hee went againe to his Father. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.28.] Herein can lye no difference, becauſe his comming from the Father, and going to his Father, both were requiſite to his firſt Act, <hi>viz.</hi> Impetration or procurement, elſe are not his owne expreſſes Orthodox, <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. where ſpeaking of things done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his going up to his Father, he ſaith, [Thereby he doth preſent before his Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo procures the grant of diſpenſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Which evidently cleareth that his Aſcending is no part of his Application, but an Act that tendeth to the perfecting of his procurement, and that done as Mediatour. Againe, His comming from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not tyed only to Impetration, but it was alſo for the effecting of Application.
<pb facs="tcp:45603:36"/> He came to ſave them that were loſt. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.11. And he dyed not to procure pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging only, but that he might Sanctifie, to Sanctifie to himſelfe a peculiar People. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. So that if the parts of his diſtinction be ſo coincident, that we may ſay, For the effecting of the former he aſcended alſo to his Father, and for the latter he came downe from the Father, then his difference falleth to the ground: as for that Text <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.28. it ſheweth only that Chriſt both came from, and alſo goeth to the Father; but it ſaith not, that he came downe only to procure, and went to him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the good things procured: So that we may ſee what libertie he takes to diſtortour Saviours words to apply them to his owne conceits without ground; Nay our Saviour ſeemes to diſclaime it, for there is more the ſoly Application, when he ſaith, [I go to prepare a place for you.] <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. His third is the ſame with this, therefore I mention it not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. [The one is a Redemption (for us) in Chriſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. The other a Redemption (of us) in Soule and body. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74.] Many leaves would not ſerve ſufficiently to diſplay the vanity of this diſtinction. Firſt, This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes that the Redemption of our ſoules and bodies was not wrought out for us, which is erroneous; if he import not ſo much, his diſtinction is frivolous. Secondly, That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth that the Application of Chriſts Bloud is not effected or ſhowne till our ſoules and bodies be glorified, which is falſe; the giving of any Mercy, the means of Grace, his Patience, is the Application of his Bloud; And if he meane not the former, he weakely expreſſeth the latter, by the Redemption of us in our ſoules and bodies. 3. The firſt he ſaith is only (for us) when in his ſixth particular he produceth Chriſts Lordſhip, Patience, Goodneſſe of God to men, as this firſt Redemption, but theſe are not only for us, but of us, and to us; endleſſe are his abſurdities, but I cloſe with this other, that Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. is abuſed, that mentioneth not this Phraſe (For us,) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerveth him not for his purpoſe; there is no expreſſion there but what agreeth to the ſecond Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> Application, therefore ſerveth not to prove a diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. I ſhall uſe only one more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. [The former is affirmed in Scripture to be for all men: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. The latter is for and to Beleevers only,] To this I Anſwer.</p>
               <p>If he can carry this by Scripture, then his weakeneſſe appeares in expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo remiſſely, as to contend in this Chapter only for this, that they are diſtinct; if the firſt be for all, the ſecond for Beleevers only, then they are not only diſtinct, but ſeparable one from the other, and one may be where the other never is; and this is a degree beyond diſtinction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſaith, (That the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Application of his Death is only for Beleevers,) how diflonant is it from himſelfe and his beſt friends the Remonſt. who unanimous that Remiſſion of Sins and Eternall Salvation is procured for all men, not only for Beleevers? Indeed they ſay it is only (to them) but (for all,) for if they be confined to Beleevers, not only (to them) in regard of enjoyment, but (for them) alſo, in regard of procurement, his common Redemption will be but a meere Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If he ſay, That the Impetration or procuring of Remiſſion and Eternall Life be for all and every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> then he muſt prove it by Scripture, that Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. proveth it not, it ſpeakes not of ſuch a Redemption, Salvation, as may be divided from Eternall Life, no nor barely of Impetration, but as it relateth to Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to follow, as when he ſaith, I come to ſave that which was loſt, and he ſhall ſave his people from their Sins, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. Neither doth the world World there meane
<pb facs="tcp:45603:36"/> every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> but he came to ſave the World, that is Men living in the World: his inference here from is no plaine Text, but a corrupt reaſoning from a cleare Text. Againe, that Text <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. confirmeth me in this Point, that Chriſt did not procure life for every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe he there ſaith, it was that only Beleevers might not periſh: It ſaith not that every one might not periſh if they beleeve, but that thoſe that beleeve, the number of which was well knowne to him. Now if Chriſts will was one and concentricall with his Fathers, he procured life for none but Beleevers: So that then not only the Application is to, but the Impetration for Beleevers only, what then becommeth of his Doctrine, That he procured life for all men whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve or no? I ſee not; this is no Scripture Language. So that now having examined his particulars of diſtinction, and finding them full of confuſion, and not diſtinct enough to be underſtood, I ſhall give the Reader a taſte of ſome new Divinity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt dyed for ſome for whom he did not live againe, as in the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he came from the Father for ſome, for whom he went not to the Father againe, as in the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he was abaſed for ſome for whom he was not exalted, as in the third.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he ſhed his Bloud for ſome for whom he preſented not his Bloud as ſhed, as in the fifth. All theſe he averreth, in that he ſaith, the former of all is done for all and every man, the latter only for Beleevers.</p>
               <p>Thus have I embowelled the diſtinction, the Chapter that treateth of it, his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions therein. And little perſpicuity or pertinency to the Queſtion can I find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo confuſed that I feare few of his Readers can gather from it what he holds, or what they ſhould cloſe withall, neither can any ingenuous man ſhew what he hath gotten of his Adverſary herein; that which is truth in it no man denyeth, yet a miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of Obſcurities, Errours, Contradictions, interwoven, it is the baſis of the whole Diſcourſe, therefore I have been more prolix in diſſecting it, leſt I ſhould over-looke any pertinent truth; (they are ſo few) tedious I know it muſt be to them that are verſt in more polite Notions; but the Nature of my Antagoniſt requires it; things of leſſe concernment ſhall be paſſed over with leſſe diſquiſition; And what he delivers herein appeares to me not to be the meaning of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. And his Propoſition being taken in this ſence here delivered, is not made out in thoſe Texts: And what proviſion he is ſupplyed with from this diſtinction ſo proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, for the taking downe of the edge of our Arguments, ſhall be ſeene in its proper place.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Wherein the Authour doth well to pitch upon the firſt and maine end of Chriſts Death, (and that in regard of the Creature,) for to treate of intermediate ends would have been but obſcure and impertinent to this Point: becauſe when we ſpeake of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ends, they are ſuch as are but <hi>media,</hi> meanes in relation to the firſt end; but to treate of meanes when the queſtion is of the end, is ſomething prepoſterous. When we treate of the end of Chriſts Death, it is preſuppoſed that we mean that which in relation to man is conſidered under no other Notion but as end, therefore he doth well to ſpeake of a firſt end; but whether he do ſo well, to ſay that that (which he layeth downe) is Chriſts firſt end in dying, muſt be further enquired into.</p>
               <p>Now when he ſaith, (Firſt end,) I hope he meaneth, firſt in Gods intention, and Chriſts, for from the intention of Agents is the priority and poſteriority of ends dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Now I ſay, [to be a Ranſome, a Sacrifice, a Propitiation] are not the firſt end of Chriſt in dying, or of God in giving his Son; and this is cleare, in that theſe all do <hi>[Tendore in finem ulteriorem,]</hi> Tend to a further end, for he is all theſe that men might be eternally ſaved; Himſelfe is cleare for this, [His being a Ranſome and Propitiation was that all men might be eternally ſaved: <hi>Pag.</hi> 18, 19.] And if he did not, Reaſon would preſently convince him, as ſhall afterwards appeare; theſe then tending to a further end, are not the firſt end, in that they tend to a further end, they are meanes, and in ſo being, they are not firſt in intention: then ſhould God intend firſt the meanes, then the end, which is abſurd.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the Author will have the procuring life and Salvation, and opening a doore, that men only may enter, and to make men ſalvable only, (for thus he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth his Phraſes of Ranſome, Propitiation,) to be the firſt end in Chriſt, then I hope he will give us ſome Scripture that ſo ſpeaketh: Scripture ſeemeth to ſpeake otherwiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. I came not to condemne but to ſave. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.11. He came to ſave that which was loſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. He came to ſave Sinners; which places I know the Author would thus temper, to make them ſalvable; but this is an unwarrantable perverſion, and all theſe which he produceth they are but ſubſervient to this firſt end; as to inſtance, As God had (out of his free conſtitution) deſigned a way of his own diſpenſations, before man can partake of heaven the Juſtice of God muſt be ſatisfied, Enmity taken away, we Reconciled, Hence this made end of God and Chriſt in his Death, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. To reconcile us, which ſuppoſe Juſtice ſatisfied, but this is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for it ſelfe but in tendency to a further end, and is not the firſt end; but that Text gives a further, <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. To preſent you holy and unblameable to him.</p>
               <p>Againe, That we may be partakers of hapineſſe, the hand-writing againſt us muſt be blotted out, and every thing that ſtands croſſe muſt be taken away: So that this
<pb facs="tcp:45603:37"/> is an end of Chriſts Death; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. But this was not done, or intended only for it ſelfe, but in tendency to eternall Salvation, and the actuall enjoyment of it, for only to this is our ſinfull eſtate contrary, and therefore a further end appeares, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3, 4. to which this ſerves but as meanes, [Yee ſhall appeare with him in glory.]</p>
               <p>Againe, That men partake of heaven, the ſtaine and power of Sin muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and we Sanctified, and Regenerate; So that this alſo is an end of Chriſts Death, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. but this not for it ſelfe, but with a tendency to further end: <hi>Ver.</hi> 27. that he might preſent it glorious <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſiſtere poſſit,]</hi> but <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſiſteret,]</hi> to cauſe it to ſtand before him glorious, denoting that the actuall enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heaven, and as certaine, is his firſt end.</p>
               <p>Againe, That men be glorified, it is requiſite that Chriſt be Lord of all, and have power over all fleſh; this therefore is an end of his Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 9. but this not for it ſelfe intended, but a tendency to the firſt end, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. He gave him power over all fleſh that he might give eternall life to as many as thou haſt given, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It is not <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t dare poſſit,]</hi> but <hi>[ut dacet]</hi> that he might actually, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give eternall life. And more intermediate ends may be produced, which may be called ends in regard of his Death, but yet not the firſt end, but rather as meanes tending to the firſt end, and ſo all theſe three particulars under his generall they all cannot make up a firſt end, but are as meanes to the firſt end: Therefore his ſetting downe them as the firſt end is not Orthodox.</p>
               <p>Againe, That to procure life, that is, that men may have it, is not the end of Chriſts Death, that is the firſt end, and maine end: Then it muſt follow, that though none be actually ſaved, yet Chriſt hath his end full and entire, and as much as he deſired, this indeed the Remoſt, ſay, but I cannot yet ſee it the Language of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is a rule that <hi>[Acquiſito fine quieſcit movens,]</hi> when any Agent hath attained his end it reſts with it, but Chriſt and God do not reſt with a poſſibility of mans Salvation, or in a doore being opened, but they go on further, Actually to lead into that doore, to invite, ſollicite, expoſtulate, perſwade, that they might actually be ſaved: He ſaith not, Why O Iſrael will not ye come into a poſſibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But why will ye dye? Why will ye not be Actually ſaved? Nay, the Author grants, that he doth not only propound meanes, give the Goſpell, and ſo open a doore by morall ſwaſion, but alſo overcome and over-power, by Phyſicall efficiency, the hearts of his Elect, and bring them in to beleeve, and bring them into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; thus <hi>Pag.</hi> 120. Now I demand, whether Chriſt did procure this? Whether Chriſt and God aimed at this in Chriſts Death, and ſo propounded it as an end? If not? <hi>Quo pacto</hi> is it applyed? Is it not the ſprinkling of the Bloud of Jeſus? If it be ſo, then that was not the firſt and maine end of Chriſt and God to make Salvation poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that Salvation ſhould be certain and Actuall. So that we may ſee how in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately the Author expreſſeth himſelfe about the ends of Chriſts Death. My next taske will be to examine what influence theſe expreſſes have upon the Queſtion in hand, and alſo of what ends, whether intermediate, or ultimate, theſe Texts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. treate.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, I conceive that this Treatiſe of the end of Chriſt in his Death doth not only not help, but utterly overthroweth his Doctrine. Herein I ſhall examine, firſt, whether the maine end (Actuall and certaine Salvation) was intended for every man: Let this be my Query, When Chriſt gave himſelfe, or determined to give him, was it for this end, to make Salvation of every man Actuall and certaine? If it was? Then I ſay, if all do not come to Salvation, he miſſeth of his end, which is not
<pb facs="tcp:45603:38"/> to be appropriated to any rationall Agent, that hath power to do what he willeth, and to bring about his purpoſes. Herein I ſuggeſt to my ſelfe ſome Remonſt. denying that an Actuall, certaine, and abſolute Salvation of any is the end of God or Chriſt in his Death: as <hi>Arminius, [Non actualis peccatorum ablatio, non actualis remiſſio, non juſtificatio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Perk. <hi>77.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>non actualis horum aut illorum redemptio, quae abſque fide &amp; ſpiritu Chriſti nemini contingunt,</hi> &amp;c. That is, not Actuall Remiſſion, Juſtification, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, (ſo no Salvation) which happen to none without Faith:] or with <hi>Corvinus, [Quod ad applicationem ſalutis attinet non intendit eam praciſe &amp; abſolute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>ſed volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it intercedere fidem hominis,</hi> As for the Application of Salvation, God willed it not abſolutely, becauſe he willed Faith to come betweene, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts Death and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;] For the aſſertion it ſelfe, I have proved that the Actuall and certaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of heaven is the <hi>(finis ultimus)</hi> in regard of the Creatures: becauſe all the reſt, even Impetration it ſelfe is but an intermediate end; It remaines that I reaſſume their reaſon whereby they prove it is not; and they are unanimous in their reaſons, and it is this, Becauſe God willed that men ſhould be ſaved by Faith; I ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to vye Authority with them; whoſe Learning and moderation I may admire; yet I muſt freely accknowledge that the ſtrength of that Reaſon is not cleare to me, no more then this. A man intendeth not a thing abſolutely, becauſe he will effect it <hi>(per m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dia)</hi> by meanes; or this, A man doth not abſolutely intend to dwell in a houſe, becauſe he intended to build it firſt, or being built, to cleanſe and garniſh it firſt; but theſe are not valid, becauſe he may intend to act the meanes, and then why he may not abſolutely will to act the end I ſee not; ſo if God intend abſolutely to give and worke faith, which is the meanes of Salvation, then he may be ſaid to will Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men abſolutely, though he willeth Faith to intervene.</p>
               <p>Againe, I can ſuggeſt to my ſelfe my Antagoniſt anſwering thus: [As for his Elect he propounds their certaine and actuall Salvation as his end, but for the reſt, His end is that they may be ſaved.] Therefore to engage with this, for that is my taske to encounter my Antagoniſt. For the reſt of men that are not Elect, what is his end? That there may be a ſalvability, or poſſibleneſſe with God of their Salvation? This I have before ſhewed cannot be the end of Chriſt to procure it, becauſe ſuch was without Chriſts Death, and that he might do it too and yet be juſt if he pleaſed; no man will purchaſe his owne Land, nor Chriſt by his Bloud procure that which all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies was without that procurement: I am yet to learne that any thing obligeth God to puniſh Sin without ſatisfaction, but his free conſtitution and determination, whereby he becometh a Law to himſelfe: But God no where hath revealed that he willeth, that without ſatisfaction mans Salvation ſhall not be poſſible; indeed, he hath tyed himſelfe not to ſave actually without ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Againe ſecondly, I deſire a proofe from Scripture of this twofold end of Chriſt, one for his Elect, that their Salvation may be certaine, a ſecond for all the reſt, that their Salvation may be poſſible, which if he can do he will performe a great taske.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I demand how this end can ſtand with that Decree of God, and that from Eternity, of giving thoſe that are not Elect up to deſtruction, for contempt of means (which he foreſeeth) as the Author averreth <hi>Pag.</hi> 120. leaving no way in Gods purpoſe for the poſſibility of their Salvation? Now if Chriſt propounded this as an end to procure life for them, how is his Will one with his Fathers?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Concerning the poſſibility of mens Salvation, I know he fetcheth it from the meanes of life propounded, it is to be had upon condition, Beleeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Now if Chriſts end, firſt and chiefe end, was this, that man might have life, and miſſe of it upon unbeleefe, and ſo be dealt withall according to the
<pb facs="tcp:45603:38"/> Tenour of the Goſpell, or as the Author ſaith, [That he might condemne or pardon as he ſaw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17.] Then it will follow, that Condemnation will have equall ſhare in his end with Salvation; but this is no Scripture Language, which ſaith, I came not to condemne the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>But if this draw more from the Author, I ſhall anſwer more, by this it ſeemes not probable that the maine end <hi>viz.</hi> the certaine and actuall enjoyment of life, was not in Chriſt for all, and every Son of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, Let us ſee whether thoſe intermediate ends which he reckoneth up often, can be ſaid to be for all, and every Son of <hi>Adam;</hi> and herein we muſt conſider that the ſatisfaction of Juſtice, taking away Sin, aboliſhing Death, ſlaying enmity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming Lord, theſe are as meanes conducing to that end, Now ends are deſired for themſelves, meanes but for the end, certainly then they run in an even aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page; thoſe things which are willed but for another thing, are willed but in the ſame reſpect with the other, for time, place, perſon, manner, for if he ſhould will the meanes to more then he willeth the end, then his will muſt be carried on the meanes without an end, or ſtronglier to the meanes then to the end, both which are abſurd, and ſo Chriſt be ſaid to ſatisfie his Fathers Juſtice, to take away Sin, to take away all that ſtood croſſe to our Salvation, to aboliſh enmity, and that at ſo deare a rate, when he never intended to bring in any to partake of life; which cannot, I conceive, be received but with detriment to Chriſt in his unſpeakeable wiſdome. No neither is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration the firſt end. (As I conceive) the Queſtion may be asked, Why Chriſt did Impetrate? And if the Anſwer be given, it ſheweth plainly that the Impetration is not the firſt end: If we ſay that Chriſt impetrated, that it might be applyed, the Remonſt. do not oppoſe, but leave it in <hi>dubio. An applicatio fit Impetrationis finis non diſpute. Corv. in Mol. Cap.</hi> 28. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. Nay, all that he produceth againſt its being the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and prociſe end, is this, that he intended Faith to come betweene, <hi>Finem iſtum non eſſe abſolute intentum ſed ita ut ad applicationem requiſita eſt conditio.</hi> Which in my judgement, do not <hi>ſe invicem deſtruere,</hi> for Faith may be requiſite and yet the Application abſolutely intended.</p>
               <p>I might take every particular by it ſelfe, and dwell upon the abſurdities that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend every one of them, but I muſt not be ſo voluminous; As when he ſaith, [The firſt end was to take away Sin before God for men, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16.] And this he ſaith is for all men, every Son of <hi>Adam:</hi> both falſe. It is not the firſt end, for may not the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be asked, Why he taketh away Sin from before God? The Anſwer, if he will give it, confuteth him, and telleth him there is a further end: neither is it done for all, the expreſſion it ſelfe is rude and abſurd (to take away Sin before God for man,) the word (to take away) muſt have a terme from which, and that muſt be either man or God: And can he take away Sin from before God, or from Man, and Man not be poſſeſt of Juſtification? this is a myſtery; Is it not all one for Sin to be taken away from before God, and for it not to be found when it is ſought for? <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. But is this the priviledge of all, or of Gods reſerve only? Let the Author in his next give me one place and prove it too, where this or any of the attendants is ſaid to be done for every Son of <hi>Adam?</hi> Many things I leave to the intelligent Reader to ſave me a labour in; I conceive that this conſideration of the end of Chriſt helpeth him little, I ſhall examine if his next do more.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Of the divers manner of mentioning theſe ends in Scripture.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E thinketh to extract much from the divers manner of propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Death of Chriſt with the ends of it; as in that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ends are joyned, ſometimes one only: Alſo the Ranſome is conſidered as in it ſelfe made, or as made known, or as men are convinced by it: Alſo, it is delivered in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſon, ſometimes in firſt, ſometimes ſecond, ſometimes third Chapter: Theſe are the Allegations of his whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but what matter there is in all theſe I ſhall Examine.</p>
               <p>[Sometimes that end of his Death which was for Propitiation, or Ranſome, is coupled with the end which was to teſtifie love, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in his Miniſtration, propounded for our example, and then ſuch generall words, as [world,] [all men,] are not uſed, becauſe his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration on earth did not reach to all the world.]</p>
               <p n="1">1. This ſeemes to affirme that the Ranſome and Miniſtration of Chriſt are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ends and not coincident, which I ſee not cleare, ſeeing his giving life a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is the greateſt peece of Service that he did for us, in doing this he did all: And this was not only one, but the greateſt peece of his Miniſtration. In that our Saviour ſaith, [I came to ſerve, and give my life a Ranſome for many;] He doth not in his latter words diſcover a diſtinct end, but rather it is an explanation of the ſervice of which he ſpeaketh; to any eye it may appeare, that to [Serve,] and to [give his life a Ranſome,] ſpeake one and the ſame thing: Chriſts words otherwhere ſeemeth to cleare it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.27. Having eaten the Supper with his Diſciples, taking his laſt leave, bequeathing himſelfe to his Croſſe, he ſaith, (I am as he that ſerveth,) which to me referreth to his Death that was ſhortly to enſue; And do not the Apoſtles words cleare it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. where he makes the Death of Chriſt, and his being obedient to the Death of the Croſſe, the explanation of his being a Servant? Nay, do not the Authors words cleare it: He ſaith, <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. [His faithfulneſſe in Miniſtration is ſet downe as an example to us to lay downe our lives for the Brethren: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.] Now what is that which moves us to lay downe our lives for the Brethren all along in Scripture, is it not Chriſts laying downe his life? Yea, that Text plainly ſpeakes of it as this Argument to move us; whereby it appeares, that to ſerve, and to give his life a Ranſome, are one, and not diſtinct ends, therefore his expreſſes are not conſonant to truth: As if he teſtified greater love and faithfulneſſe, or more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently moved us to give our lives for the Brethren, in any thing than in this giving his life a Ranſome.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:45603:39"/>2. Whereas he ſaith, [Such generall words are not uſed becauſe his Miniſtration reaches not to all.] This is <hi>nobis cauſam tradere,</hi> to give us the Queſtion: If his giving his life a Ranſome was his ſerving, and his ſerving reach not to all, how can the other? where is his Doctrine then? And till he can prove that his ſerving, and his giving his life a Ranſome are diſtinct, I ſhall accept his poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> his Miniſtration reached not to all the world, ſo neither his giving his Life a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>[Sometimes that end which was for Ranſome, is coupled together with that end which was for ſealing the New-Teſtament, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to all men, but his choſen ones, that have partaken of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Call; and then ſuch generall words as cannot in any ſenſe be appropriated to ſome particular, as (world) (all men) are not uſed, nor yet ſuch a word as may not be applyed ſo generally, but ſo as his word may be applyed to either or both ſenſes as occaſion ſhall ſerve. Hence <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. This is my Bloud of the New-Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of Sins,]</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas he ſpeaketh of a [New-Teſtament, and the ſealing thereof, which belongeth not to all;] either I underſtand him not, or he underſtandeth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Firſt, I underſtand not whether he meaneth not the Teſtament it ſelfe, or the ſealing thereof belongs not to all: for he loveth to lurke in ambiguities, (though but poor ſhelter,) If he meane the latter, then he intimateth that the Covenant is not ſealed to ſo many as it is made, which is not probable: If he meane the firſt, I am yet to ſeeke what he meaneth by the New-Teſtament; if I underſtand him, he meaneth nothing but the new Covenant promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> and preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Now that Covenant and Teſtament are Synonimous is cleare from Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. in many places mentioneth the Old and New-Teſtament, in 8, 9, 10. <hi>verſes,</hi> which allude to <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33. but there the Text runneth Covenant, not Teſtament; Nay, ſome Tranſlations read <hi>Heb,</hi> 8.8, 9, 10. Covenant, ſome read Teſtament; where ever the word Covenant or Teſtament is uſed, it is by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, So <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, And <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. ſome read it two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, And in that Text cited by him <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15. Mediatour of the New-Teſtament, yet it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So it is cleare that Covenant and Teſtament is all one. Indeed every Covenant is not a Teſtament, but in this caſe every Covenant that God makes with us is made in Chriſt, and ſealed with the death of the Covenant-maker, therefore a Teſtament. And this appeares by his own words, [All which being by Covenant,<note place="margin">Pag 20.</note> or as in a Will and Teſtament plainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, are called the New Teſtament.] Now if I underſtand him in all this, he ſpeaketh thus much, that [The new Covenant belongs not to all, but to his choſen ones;] but herein I thinke he doth not well underſtand himſelfe. Now that he thus meaneth appeareth by his own words, <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. [For ſuch as beleeve, and ſo come in to Chriſt, there are for them many gracious Promiſes from Chriſt and his Father, contained in one generall, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternall life:] But here he engageth the Remonſt. againſt him, they contend that God doth <hi>(Novum foedus inire cum onibus,)</hi> Enter into a new treaty with every man; and <hi>Corvinus</hi> labours in vaine when he thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,<note place="margin">In Molin, c. <hi>29.</hi> Sect. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>[Quare quum primum foedus pertinuerit ad omnes quia cum primo homine ut ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is bumani ſtirpe fuit initum, oportet ut eadem ſit ratio ſecundi foederis;]</hi> That is, As the firſt Covenant was to all men, ſeeing made to the firſt Man, as the Stock or Root
<pb facs="tcp:45603:40"/> of all; So it is requiſite it ſhould be in the ſecond;] &amp; it hath hitherto been the taske of the contra-Remonſtrants to prove that the new Covenant belongeth only to ſome, as appeares in that from <hi>Gen</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Molin</hi> pleades it to be peculiar, but <hi>Corvinus</hi> anſwereth, <hi>[Merito dicimus eſſe generalem quum non probas eam reſtringi.]</hi> But now the Author ſaves us that labour, we have it <hi>ex confeſſo;</hi> but that I may in a few words preſent him with the conſequences of this his Aſſertion, I would have him ſhew me what is the new Covenant? I know he will ſay the Promiſe of eternall life; ſo he intimateth <hi>Pag.</hi> 20 and of thoſe things that conduce to it: Then I aske how this life is promiſed, abſolutely, or upon condition? I know he will ſay upon the condition of Faith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved: and ſo all the conducements to eternall life, and life it ſelfe, as <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. are by the new Covenant tyed to Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. Now let him tell me, are not all under this Covenant? Do not all come under the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſalvability by vertue of this Covenant, becauſe they may have life upon beleeving? Are not all under the Command of beleeving? And doth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand go without the Promiſe? Let him ſtand to his owne principles, and ſpeake out. Can every man be ſaid to be Reconciled, Redeemed, Juſtified, Saved, if they be not under ſuch a Covenant or Promiſe of having Actuall Reconciliation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Juſtification, Salvation, if they beleeve? What is that new Treaty that he ſpeakes of <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. into which God brings all men? Nay, this overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his whole Diſcourſe. What Goſpell is there to be preached to them that are not under the Covenant? The Goſpell ſaith, Beleeve and live; but is this to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them that are not under the Covenant of having life upon Faith? Theſe if he be fixed to his owne principles are of ſome force. It is not enough to ſay that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant belongs only to Beleevers, that they ſhall not periſh, for he holds that yet every particular it is true of them that they ſhall have life (and it is ſo promiſed) upon beleeving, as he urgeth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 130. [It is ſo a truth for mankind, that it is a truth for them all, that whoever of them beleeve ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life.] And what is this but to be under the Covenant? The buſineſſe muſt come to this iſſue, that there are two new Covenants, the one under which the Elect is, the other under which the reſt are, which will be hard to prove; or elſe that all men are under the Covenant of Grace; or thirdly, that God hath not entered into a new Covenant and Treaty by Chriſt with every man, according to which God may conferre and deny life, both which latter are diſſonant to himſelfe, and deſtructive to his cauſe: This I ſay, not to oppoſe his Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> [That the New-Teſtament belongs not to all:] If it had not been his, it ſhould have been mine; But I herein diſcover, when a man underſtandeth not himſelfe, how ſoone he may cut his throat with his owne knife, and ſtrangle his opinion with his owne words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſaith, [Belong not to all, but to his choſen ones] he is here ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and indiſtinct, becauſe his choſen ones may be all men in the Authors Divinity, for he makes an Election to Service, with which all are Elected to Service, <hi>Pag.</hi> 118.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas he explaineth (Choſen ones) by [partaking of the heavenly Call.] Herein he needeth an Interpreter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 9.</note> becauſe in many places of his Diſcourſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth for this, that all men partake of the heauenly Call, as [Thus he calls in ſome degree or other all the Sons of men;] And to this end, that they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Sin: <hi>Pag.</hi> 23. There is a difference between partaking of the Call, and the efficacie thereof, in being by it wrought upon to beleeve; the latter I confeſſe he ſaith is not to all, but the firſt is, if he divine right; Therefore for him to ſay, [To his choſen ones that partake of his heavenly Call,] unleſſe he will have all to be choſen, involveth himſelfe, and if he will, he doth no leſſe for to ſay (it belongs not to all,
<pb facs="tcp:45603:40"/> but to his choſen ones, and thoſe that partake of the heavenly Call,) which may take in (all) is abſurd: But any may ſee he ſeekes ſo to temper his Pen, that his Reader may mould him either way according to his owne temper, but this becomes impoſtors rather then thoſe that pretend they preach Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas he ſaith, [And then ſuch generall words as (world,) (all men,) which cannot be (in any ſence) applyed to ſome only, are not uſed;] wherein he tacitely implyeth that the words [World,] [All men,] are never taken for ſome only; The proper deciſion of which will fall in another place; therefore I ſhall only put him in mind of his owne words, <hi>Pag</hi> 30. where he ſaith, [The Phraſe (All men) is uſed ſo, as it cannot be meant of Gods people, good men, hearers of the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor the Elect of God.] Certainely then if all the Elect of God, and all Beleevers, and Hearers of the Word of God be excluded, this Phraſe is to be meant but of ſome: and now his taske will be to give a good Reaſon why the words (All men,) may not meane, all the Good, excluding the Bad, as well as all the Bad, excluding the Good; the propriety of Language is indifferent to either; Nay, ſhame will not ſuffer him to prevaricate, but he confeſſeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. [That there is an All of upright and Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,] as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. Every man ſhall have praiſe of God, as well as an All of Bad, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. So that I need not oppoſe him in his Aſſertion, he doth it effectually for me himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas he ſaith, [He ſo ſpeaketh as the words may be taken in either or both ſenſes, as occaſion ſhall ſerve,] Is an affirmation concerning Scripture beyond all preſident, that one word (like <hi>Rebecca</hi> her wombe) ſhould containe in the bowels of it two ſuch different ſenſes as (All,) and (but ſome only,) and that to ſerve two Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as men ſhall refer it to one or the other, this is to make his owne Calumny that he groundleſly laid on our backs to be his own burthen: that is, to make the Word of God like the Heathen Oracles, true whether way ſoever we take them; neither is there any need in this place ſo to torture the words of Scripture, for both Phraſes, <hi>viz.</hi> (Bloud in the New-Teſtament,) and [Shed for Remiſſion of Sins,] will both agree in (many) taken in one ſence, and that taken as ſignifying only ſome. But whether all this tendeth, it is not eaſie to determine, but I conjecture it is this, to prove that where he ſpeakes of Chriſt Death, and uſeth this word (Many) it is no argument againſt him, becauſe (All) are (Many,) and the word (Many) may comprehend (All) Thus the Remonſt, ſpeake, and I ſuppoſe he intendeth: but then he muſt know this is brought but as a probable Argument, that ſeeing the Scripture ſaith (All,) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (Many;) it is probable that (All) is expounded by (Many,) and herein it is ſtill in force, that ſeeing more places may be brought (yet hundreds to one) where the word Many excludes All, then where it taketh in All, we are to follow moſt frequent acceptation of Scripture unleſſe we find ſome let from other Scriptures, or the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of Faith.</p>
               <p>Again, He urgeth ſomething from the various conſideration of the Ranſome, thus.</p>

               <p>Here we have many words to little purpoſe; in this Controverſie ranſome was never yet taken in any other ſence then as made in Chriſt, and made known in the Goſpell:
<pb facs="tcp:45603:41"/> It was never yet queſtioned whether the Application of it was common, or whether every man was wrought upon by the Goſpell to receive him, therefore he might have reſerved his deciſion in theſe words, [The laſt is peculiar not common,] till it had been ſeaſonable. And this he ſaith is common to all, and every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> but he proveth it not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> (The making of it known in the Goſpell,) he affirmeth it to be generall, and done to every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> but he produceth not one Text that proveth it: Yea, he elſewhere affirmeth, that every man hath ſo much light as that he may be thereby convinced, becauſe he hath not beleeved, as <hi>P.</hi> 23. But this wanteth its proofe from the Word of God: Certainely if ſome ſhall be judged without the Law, ſome ſhall be judged without the Goſpell, for thoſe that are judged without Law, are judged meerely by the light of Nature, but ſuch are judged without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, for Nature meerely ſo, diſcovereth no Goſpell, and why thoſe that never knew it a duty to beleeve, can be ſaid to have ſo much light as to convince them for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, I ſee not. Certainely that which doth not convince me that it is my duty to beleeve, cannot convince me it is my Sin not to beleeve; the Remonſt. durſt not riſe ſo high as to ſay that every man had ſo much light;<note place="margin">Arm. in Pork. <hi>158, 159.</hi>
                  </note> but thus, he either hath or might have had, if he had uſed naturals well, or had it not been for their Predeceſſors that refuſed Grace and ſupernaturall Light, as <hi>[Cauſa cur Deus non omnibus &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis hominibus Chriſtum revelet, haec eſt, quod parentes illorum verbum Evangelii repudiaverunt.]</hi> And if inſtead of proving the third not to be common, (which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh) he had proved the former two to be common to, and for every man, he had better quit himſelfe. As for that Expreſſion, [He ſhall ſo farre ſee the travell of his Soule,] argues that either he ſeeth not ſome part of his travell, becauſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts that diminutive (ſo far;) or elſe that Chriſt in his bitter Paſſion travelled with nothing but this, that men might be convinced that Chriſt is their Lord, either in Salvation or Condemnation: both which are abſurd. Now by this diſtinction he hath gotten nothing, becauſe that the hearts of all men are wrought on by the Goſpell to receive Chriſt, no man hath ſaid: and that the Ranſome was made in Chriſt with God for every man, or diſcovered to every man and Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> no man (that I know of) ever yet proved.</p>
               <p>Having diſpatched a twofold diverſity, he comes to third, and more elaborate, but as little ſucceſſefull, and that is from the diverſity of Perſon, and he ſaith thus.</p>
               <p>[The Ranſome in himſelfe [as the Creation of men by Chriſt] is mentioned diverſly in reſpect of Perſon.] Herein I may not paſſe by his falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious jumbling together Creation and Redemption, which are not of equall latitude and extent, which I ſhould not have noted here (ſeeing there is a particular Chapter for it,) but that his fallacy herein may dazle the eyes of his non-diſcerning Readers, therefore I only now ſay thus much, that betwixt Creation and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is no proportion nor Argument validly drawne, either Negative or Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; as if all thoſe were Redeemed that were created; Certainly if Creation ſhould be the meaſure of Redemption, then all Creatures ſhould be Redeemed, yea devils; and thoſe Creatures that had the preheminence in the Creation ſhould have it alſo in Redemption, but we ſee it in both contrary, in that the fallen Angels are not redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all; and theſe two [He hath Created all things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.] and [He hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled all things.] <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. Are not of the ſame latitude: For take the latter in the largeſt ſenſe you can deſire, yet it will come ſhort of the former; in that he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things, yea Thrones, Principallities, even Angels that fell: but no Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:45603:41"/> ſaith that he reconciled them. Beſides whom he Reconciled he dyed for; but it is no Scripture Language to ſay that he dyed for all things, or for all that he Created, but only for man, in ſo much as he aſſumed no other but mans nature; of this more in its place, only this I deſire, that he will ſtand to his principles, <hi>Pag.</hi> 31.

Now <hi>Peter</hi> is rationall becauſe a man, and Rationality agreeth firſt to man, and then to <hi>Peter</hi> becauſe a man, ſo though not <hi>Peter</hi> only, yet Man only is rationall: So <hi>Paul</hi> is redeemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Sheepe, but being Redeemed, agrees firſt to the Sheep of Chriſt, then to <hi>Paul</hi> being one of them: Therefore though not <hi>Paul</hi> only, yet for his Sheepe only, and this place contradicteth it not.

And whereas he ſaith, [Theſe generall places are not to be oppoſed by thoſe with reſtrictive application.] True, but they are to be explained by them, that they are expoſitours one of another; we need not doubt but the generall cannot expound particulars, but the particulars may the generall, and that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. ſpeake generally I grant, but that they ſettle us in the ſenſe without comparing with other places I queſtion: So in all this what he hath ſtrengthned himſelfe, or weakened us, let any judge.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E begins with ſuch waies of propounding, as (he ſaith) do not ſhew for how many Chriſt dyed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. [Sometimes for an example to Beleevers to follow in love, and as a motive thereto, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1, 2.] This is a truth, but then let us conſider the manner of propounding, when the Apoſtle propounds the duty of love, we may aſſure our ſelves he uſeth the moſt forcible arguments, and that would
<pb facs="tcp:45603:44"/> be the great love of God, for certaine it is, the greater the love of God appeares to us, the more forcible argument it is to love others; but in our Authors judgement, the love of God is then magnified when it appeares to be to all and every man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly the Apoſtle would have uſed this argument if it had been truth that Chriſt gave himſelfe for every Son of <hi>Adam.</hi> When our Saviour exhorteth to love of Enemies (though a ſufficient argument he might have had from the love of God to ſome being enemies) he uſeth this argument, becauſe in truth he might, that Gods love is to all, Sun ſhineth on juſt and unjuſt, <hi>Math</hi> 5.44, 45. Then did he magnifie the goodneſſe of God: Certainly then if it had been ſo that Chriſt had given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for all, he would have expreſſed it, as the moſt forcible argument of love.</p>
               <p>[If the love be of Beleevers one to another, then he thus ſets it forth, as having loved us.] True, but then we muſt conſider what kind of love it is that he exhorteth to, it is not ſuch as is common to all with Beleevers, but a love peculiar to Beleevers: <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 1, 2. Walke in love one to another; we are to beare ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of love to all as to compaſſionate them, but inward love of complacency we owe only to the Saints. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.4. Now let us conſider what is a ſutable argument to move to this, a love that is common to all, or a peculiar love? Certainly a common love cannot be a fit argument to move to a ſpeciall love, it ſeemes conſonant to reaſon, that as it was a peculiar love he exhorted them to, ſo it was a peculiar love he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by. Now if he exhort them by a peculiar love, and this love is limited to, and expreſt by, his giving himſelfe for them, it cannot be meant of ſuch a giving for them that is common to all with them.</p>
               <p>[If the love be to be enlarged to any relation, as Husband and Wife, then thus; hath loved his Church and given himſelfe for it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25.] True, But let us conſider that the love of Husbands is to be ſuch to their Wives as excludeth love to any other; Then certainly the love by which he moveth to it is ſuch as is to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Church and no other: for that love which is common to all cannot be a fit argument to a peculiar love to our Wives only; he ſaith not, Husbands love your Wives, for God is good, he loveth all, cauſeth Sun to ſhine on good and bad, then might a man thus argue.</p>
               <p>I muſt love my Wife as Chriſt loved his Church: But Chriſt loved his Church ſo as that he loved every man elſe, therefore I may love my Wife yet ſo as to love every woman, what would this open a doore unto and follow our Author? and this cannot be avoyded; therefore his giving himſelfe for his Church, being an argument to move to a ſpeciall love, cannot be thought to be in common to all.</p>
               <p>[If the love be to be exerciſed to unbeleeving ones, or Adverſaries, then it is thus, he hath ſuffered for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 24. for the unjuſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14, 18.] The Author miſtaketh thoſe Texts, they ſhew not our duty to love Adverſaries, but to be obedient to froward Maſters, and to be patient under ſufferings for well-doing, and as an argument he uſeth Chriſts Death for Sinners, and for them being Sinners. But to take his argument as it is laid downe by him, the love is a generall love to all, even enemies. Now certainly if the thing had been true, he would have uſed this as an argument, for he dyed or ſuffered for all, but this he no where doth, no nor by a diviſion which taketh in all, as he dyed for juſt and unjuſt, but only unjuſt; not meaning all unjuſt, but them Beleevers who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt when Chriſt dyed for them: Therefore conſidering that in ſuch a caſe it is a moſt pregnant argument, and he not uſing it, it may appeare that it is not a truth that
<pb facs="tcp:45603:44"/> Chriſt gave himſelfe for all and every man. Under this ranke of Scriptures there are few others that require any anſwer, they being not places uſed by us, therefore might be paſſed by; but one place or two I ſhall mention.</p>
               <p>[1 <hi>Cor</hi> 8.11, 13.] Which place, he ſaith, containeth an argument to make love operative to Brethren. But let us conſider the expreſſion: If the Authors Doctrine had been truth, certaine it would have run thus, [Shall a man periſh for whom Chriſt dyed?] Becauſe he ſaith that Chriſt dyed for all men as men: But he ſaith, [ſhall a Brother periſh for whom Chriſt dyed?] As if he dyed for none but ſuch as come under the notion of Brother.</p>
               <p>[2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.] Which he ſaith is an argument to make love operative to all men, but therein he is deceived, there is no ſuch duty commanded in that Text. But the Author diſcovers his ingenuity in that he bringeth this Text in the number of them that do not ſhew how many he dyed for, when they ſay he dyed for all, and in other places is produced as a proofe for his firſt Redemption for all and every man; one more there is of ſome conſequence.</p>
               <p>[Sometimes it is propounded to ſuch as are overſeers of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to admoniſh them to keep this Doctrine firmely, and teach it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11.15. To provoke them to watchfulneſſe over them. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. To conſtancy in ſufferings. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. But theſe ſhew not how many he dyed for.]</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for that Text, I wonder that he ſhould ſay that that place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. ſheweth not how many he dyed for, what was the reaſon that in <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. he brings this place to prove the firſt Redemption for all and every one? And that place that proves that, certainly ſheweth for how many he dyed, for he dyed not for more then All, however the Author hath loſt his memory in the croud of Notions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For that Text <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. We muſt firſt conſider that this is a ſpeciall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar care that the Apoſtle exhorteth to, and the arguments by which he moveth is twofold: Firſt, Their Charge, they were made overſeers. Secondly, Chriſts Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, he purchaſed them with his owne Bloud. Now cleare it is that that care the Apoſtle exhorteth them to was a peculiar care, and that firſt argument from their Charge was a peculiar and ſpeciall Charge, and ſo muſt the ſecond be alſo of Chriſts Purchaſe, for ſtill I ground my reaſon upon this, <hi>[Aequalis acquiſitio non poteſt eſſe fundamentum inaequalis curae.]</hi> What reaſon can be ſhewen why the Death of Chriſt, and the Purchaſe with his Bloud, can be given as an argument to move the Elders to a peculiar care over the ſlocke above others, if he equally purchaſed others with them. It is not congruous with Scripture to give ſuch Heterogenious arguments; when God commanded not to ſhed the bloud of men, he ſaith not becauſe he is a Creature, for this being common with other Creatures moves no more to the care of mans life, then to care for any Creatures life; But thus, for he is the Image of God, and this is peculiar to man from other Creatures. Let the Author ſearch the Scripture, and ſee whether it gives any argument from a common thing to move to a ſpeciall duty and faithfulneſſe over ſuch and ſuch. Till I heare further I ſhall conclude that Chriſt purchaſed none but the Flocke.</p>
               <p>So that theſe places produced by him, although they do not define how many he dyed for, yet they clearely ſay that he did not dye for all, and by cleare and ſtrong intimation averre that he did not give himſelfe for every man in the world.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of waies of propounding follows, wherein he ſaith, that we have it ſhewne for how many Chriſt dyed, as followes,</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45603:45"/>
               <p>[Sometimes it is laid downe as the foundation laid to offer life, and bring in ſuch as knew it not, to beleeve. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. &amp; 3.16, 17. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to ſuch as beleeve, to ſhew what Goſpell was preached among them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14, &amp;c. To be a ground of praiſe for ſuch as beleeve not. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And here ſhall we find the queſtion reſolved how many he dyed for.]</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſaith, [It is propounded as a ground to offer life, and bring in men to beleeve,] He ſeems to averre theſe three things, all which want truth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever probation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whereſoever the Death of Chriſt is propounded as a ground of offering life, it is propounded in generall termes, as All men, Every man, The world: But this is falſe, for it is laid downe as a ground of Faith and offering life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.51. In all theſe it is as plainly propounded for a ground of offering life as any he can produce, yet not in generall termes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That where it is propounded in generall termes, it is propounded as a ground of Faith and offering life: but this is falſe, for in 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.6. there it is in generall termes, but it not to offer life, or beget Faith, but to move Beleevers to love, and to exerciſe it in praiſe for all men: as <hi>Ver.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is no ground to offer life unleſſe it be propounded in generall termes: but this is falſe, for that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. is a firme ground of offering life, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Goſpell, yet no generall termes: Though this be true, that Chriſt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life and Salvation but for ſome of all ſorts, yet this is ground enough of offering life to all of all ſorts, and to admoniſh every man to repent.</p>
               <p>So for the reſt much may be ſaid to them, but in all there is not the leaſt beame of light added to the Truth, multitude of words ſerve only to bleare the eyes of his Reader, and this advantage he hath by them, the Truth hath none; and cleare it is that thoſe Texts 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. are to be explained by places that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the ſame end, which do not at all neceſſitate them to be taken in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſeace.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the differences of the extent of the ſame word, when ſpoken of and by men, and when of and by God, alſo when the oppoſition is betwixt men and men, and when betwixt God and men.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He end of the Author in this Chap. (as I conceive) is this: Seeing the Seat of much Controverſy is placed in theſe words (All,) (Every,) (World,) urged in all places cited by them, to be taken in an abſolute generall ſenſe, taking in all the Individualls in the world: But by us they are urged to have a limited ſenſe, as we inſtance in many Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they cannot be taken ſo largely; His intent therefore is to ſhew the weakeneſſe of
<pb facs="tcp:45603:45"/> our Allegations, and that our places are not to be rules for the expounding of theirs becauſe ours are ſpoken of and by men, theirs of and by God; but how he quits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe herein I ſhall in few words examine. Now wherein we both agree is as followeth:</p>
               <p>[That the ſame words in divers Sentences may differ much in ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and extent, and yet by the Sentence the ſignification will clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare; thus he ſaith <hi>Pag.</hi> 28.] This I acknowledge and ſhall improve, for then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why doth the Author ſay that (All,) when ſpoken of Creation, and when of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, muſt be taken in the ſame ſence and latitude, will he not be ſo farre fixed to his principles as to ſuffer the divers matter treated of to alter the ſignification of the ſame word?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It deſerveth examination, whether the matter treated of in thoſe places doth ſuffer the words to be taken in that large ſenſe, which light is to be fetched from Scriptures, which teacheth us that the word (All) when ſpoken of Redemption is to to be taken ſo largely, or elſe what he ſaith will want proofe.</p>
               <p>Againe we agree in this.</p>
               <p>[It is ungodly and unequall to compare God and man, and to make them to be alike and equall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.13, 14. and mere ungodlines to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the words, workes, and thoughts of God with mans, and to make them equall and alike, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8, 9.] Thus he urgeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>This I grant: But then I muſt advertiſe the Author of two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is one thing to compare the beings of man and God together, of which his quoted Text ſpeaketh, which cannot be alike, and another to compare Gods Actions and words, which may be alike ſometimes, as we are commanded to be like our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father, this laſt is no ſuch ungodlineſſe as he pretendeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a difference betwixt mans words as comming from man and oppoſed to Gods, and mans words as comming from God and the dictate of his Spirit, of this ſecond ſort it is no ungodlineſſe to compare them to Gods, for they are his own, which will be uſefull to us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we further agree in this.</p>
               <p>[It is eaſie for men to underſtand a difference in the extent of the ſame word ſpoken of and by God, and ſpoken of and by men, and when the oppoſition is betwixt God and men, and when between men and men.] This I grant, for 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. he ſaith (ye know all things,) and <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.20. he ſaith, (He <hi>(viz. God)</hi> knoweth all things,) no reaſon will hence conclude that God knoweth no more then man knoweth, or that man is omniſcient,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is eaſie alſo to know the difference of the ſame word when ſpoken of and by God, if ſo be it be concerning divers Actions, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. [The Spirit ſhall teach you all things,] and <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. he ſaith, [He knoweth all things:] So <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24. [He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all men:] and <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32. [I will draw all men to me;] No reaſon will infer that he will draw all, or ſo many as in that place he is ſaid to know; ſo when he is ſaid to create all things, and to reconcile all things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1 16.20. both cannot be taken in the ſame latitude and extent, becauſe he made the fallen Angels, but he never reconciled them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is alſo cleare that many places ſpeakes of God, and is ſpoken by God, and holy men inſpired by God, which is all one as if it was Gods immediate word, yet
<pb facs="tcp:45603:46"/> thoſe words (All,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot beare that large extent, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.44. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. But what need I fill Paper and trouble the Reader, when my Adverſary confeſſeth that the word (all) is ſometimes taken for all upright, ſometimes for all ungodly: certainly then thoſe words when ſpoken of and by God are not alwaies to extend themſelves to that large ſenſe he pretendeth, which being true, ſheweth the weakeneſſe of that diſtinction, and freeth thoſe following examples from that ignorance, raſhneſſe, which he out of greater ignorance and raſhneſſe chargeth them with.</p>
               <p>And ſtill I admit,</p>
               <p>[That if a man ſpake of a Family, and ſay this man governes all, it is to be meant of all in the Family, ſo of a Corporation and a Kingdome,] But he muſt obſerve this, that ſo we could not underſtand unleſſe that the word (All) in propriety might have a limited ſence.</p>
               <p>And we grant alſo, [That if we ſay God governeth all, we meane all in the World,] But if our Author had gone on to make his matter out he ſhould have ſaid, [So if we ſhould ſay Chriſt redeemed all, we muſt meane all in the world.] Herein he would have erred, ſeeing there is no proportion betwixt his Gubernation and his Redemption, the difference of matter treated of admits of a difference in the ſignification of the ſame word, according to his owne principles. And herein the Author is at a loſſe in all this, for all that he hath ſaid in this buſineſſe is to make way for this, That where God or Chriſt is ſaid to Redeeme or Ranſome all, it muſt be all and every man in the world; but this will not be admitted, though when we ſay God governeth all, we meane all things in the world. Now to proceed to the Texts alleaged by us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1. &amp; 15.1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.8. Where we urge that world, whole world, all men, every man, are not to be taken in that large and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſenſes; therefore without further reaſon we cannot grant thoſe places alleadged by him to be ſo generall; he thus anſwers, [It will be found either ignorance or raſhneſſe to compare, and make of like large extent the word (world) in <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1. and the word (world) in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.] But it will be found an ignorant Calumny ſo to charge us, we make them not of like large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as if he were the Propitiation for the ſins of no more then was in the Roman Empire, or went then to be taxed, this is abſurd to affirme, and a wilfull injury to faſten it on us; but thus we ſay, that as the word (world) in <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1. (being ſpoken by the Evangeliſt inſpired by God) doth not take in all and every Individuall in the world: So neither the word (World) in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. though ſpoken of God and Chriſt; and where is the ignorance and raſhneſſe in all this?</p>
               <p>As for that Text <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.1. [There went a Decree that all the world ſhould be Taxed.] If it had run thus [that all ſhould be taxed] it had ſuted with his expreſſions, and we might eaſily apprehend it to extend to no further then all of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: But this more Emphaticall [that all the world ſhould be taxed.] Let the Author tell me why, when the Spirit of God is to ſpeake of ſome only in the Roman Empire, he ſhould uſe ſuch a generall word as (All the world) it this Phraſe might not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a limited ſence even when it is ſpoken of and by God. So the (All) that came to Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.1. we make not of large and like and equall extent with the (All) he dyed for: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. As if he dyed for no more then at that time came to Jeſus. But thus we ſay, that if when the Evangeliſt ſaith, All came to him, it taketh not in every Individuall Sinner in the world: So when the Apoſtle ſaith Chriſt dyed for all, it is
<pb facs="tcp:45603:46"/> not neceſſarily taken in that large ſence which the Author pretends; and all this ſheweth no weakeneſſe in our cauſe, the weakeneſſe may be eaſily ſeene elſewhere. In the cloſe of this Chapter he deſcendeth to ſhew how many waies thoſe Phraſes (All men,) (Every man,) (World,) (Whole world,) are taken: But no whit perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to his buſineſſe in this Chapter, yet I ſhall recite them, happily ſome may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. [For every one of mankind without exception, as all are gone out of the way, all have ſinned, all muſt appeare before God.] This we grant, but he cannot prove that the Scripture affirmeth Chriſt to have dyed for (All,) or that thoſe places wherein Chriſt is ſaid to dye for (All) to be taken in this ſence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. [For one another, rich and poore, Beleevers and unbeleevers.]</p>
               <p>If he meane all and every one of thoſe kinds, then it is the ſame with the firſt, and ſo a vaine repetition, and if but ſome of thoſe kinds, then it is nothing againſt us, for that is ſtill a limited ſenſe, and we grant that he dyed for all; and thoſe places that ſay Chriſt dyed for all we willingly grant them in this ſenſe, whether ſpoken by men, or by God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. [So as not meant of Gods people, good men, Beleevers.] True, and more oppoſite proofes might be produced then he bringeth; but this is not againſt us, or for him, becauſe he himſelfe will not ſay that Chriſt dyed for this All, and ſo to exclude his People and Beleevers, or any place ſo to be taken whether ſpoken by man or God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. [For all upright, Beleevers, ſpirituall men.] Which he doth not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe as a fourth acceptation of the Phraſe (All men,) which had been honeſt and ingenuous dealing, but he tacitely implyeth it, as if he would not have that taken notice of, as any may ſee <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. and he had good reaſon ſo to expreſſe himſelfe, for it doth not a little helpe us, for it that place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. where (All men) is uſed, doth not take in every individuall man in the world, even then when it is ſpoken of God, it may alſo be that thoſe places, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. though ſpoken of Chriſt, are not taken in that large ſence that he pretendeth: And then to what iſſue all his words in this Chapter come, let the wiſe judge. Something I find in <hi>Pag</hi> 31, 32. purpoſely ſet downe to prevent miſtakes and cavills, he ſaith thus, [The Death of Chriſt as a Ranſome is to be underſtood of the Death of Chriſt as riſen, and aſcended,] Which words have neither pertinency nor perſpicuity, they are of no uſe at all in this Chapter, or the buſineſſe treated of in it, neither can they well be underſtood, therefore they no way conduce to prevent miſtakes, rather to raiſe them: his words are ſo laid downe as that no man can tell whether he make his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion conduce to his Impetration or Purchaſe, to his Application, to ſay, [That it was the Death of Chriſt as he is riſen again and aſcended,] May admit of either, there is a difference betwixt things aſſociated and coupled in the ſame Action: The manhood of Chriſt with his Divinity ſuffered, but not the manhood and the Divinity: Faith with Workes juſtified, but not Faith and Workes: So his Death with his Reſurrection was the means of Purchaſe or Ranſome, but hence it doth not follow that his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion are themſelves meanes of procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or belong to the Impetration; And this ambiguous way of expreſſion he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth from the Arminians, as <hi>Corvinus, [Cum amiſſae ſalutis Impetratio immediatus fructus eſt Chriſti mortis talis mors omnino intelligitur quae reſurrectionem habeat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctam.]</hi> And that to ſerve at need their contradictions in this point,<note place="margin">In Molin, cap. <hi>28.438.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:45603:47"/> affirming, ſometimes denying, that his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion belong to his Impetration: But this I ſay as formerly, that Reſurrection and Aſcenſion is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with his Death that it hath equall ſhare in the Impetration, and hath no ſhare in the Application, as in every bargaine the bare depoſiting ſo much money as is agreed for any where, is no true payment, but the bringing of it to his houſe to whom it is paid, or at a place appointed, ſo in this, though nothing more was to be paid as price, yet ſomething elſe was to be done <hi>viz.</hi> preſenting that Bloud as ſhed, without which no perfect Impetration, as in the Law there there was as we I <hi>oſtenſio</hi> as <hi>mactatio,</hi> the ſhewing as the ſhedding of Bloud.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the Author, either his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion belong to the Impetration, or not? if not? whether tend theſe words? [His Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are herein comprehended. <hi>Pag.</hi> 32.] Meaning his firſt Redemption, and ſuch as is done for all, which in his Language is the Purchaſe or procurement, and if it do, whether tend theſe words? as [For effecting the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſecond Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which is the Application) he left the world and went to his Father.] In one part he affirmeth them to belong to the Impetratory part, in another to belong to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory part: and is this to prevent doubts and cavills. Whoever followes the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhall run into uncertainties and contradictions; and as carefull as he is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſtakes, and confident that any that will may underſtand, yet I dare avouch, that not any of his admiring Readers can give a good account of him, neither do they know whereof he affirmeth, I wiſh he himſelfe knew better.</p>
               <p>In his ſeventh Chapter, I find the Authours Catechiſme wherein he hath the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of framing both Queſtions and Anſwers: But therein there is nothing but what is ſpoken of elſewhere, therefore there being nothing worth repeating I paſſe over to the next, which is more materiall.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the more enlarged proofe of the Propoſition.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Authors ſcope in this Chapter is to prove his aſſertion by the place that Chriſt ſtood in, <hi>viz.</hi> of a publike Perſon, and that as he was to anſwer his figure <hi>Adam</hi> who was a publique Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his inference is this; As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> being a publique Perſon ſtood in the place of every individuall man, ſo Chriſt as a Publique Perſon muſt ſtand in the roome of ſo many, elſe he anſwereth not his Figure, and this is the ſumme of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but how ſtrongly this argueth for him I ſhall briefly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But before he treate of the Compariſon it ſelfe he gives us ſome premiſes which deſerve a little examination.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="tcp:45603:47"/>1. [The buſineſſe which we are to view is the worke of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought by Jeſus, and ſo of thoſe workes from God, outward, and towards his Creatures, and ſo not of thoſe workes which are in himſelfe, ſo only in Chriſt, and for Chriſt, as his ſecret Counſels of Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Firſt, This premiſe altogether needleſſe, becauſe the buſineſſe we are about is Redemption, he need not therefore feare that any would tranſlate the Controverſie to Election.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why would he rather diſpute of Gods Acts upon the Creatures, then his Acts in himſelfe concerning the Creature, doth not he know that he worketh according to his Will? and doth not he ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> 120 121. [Looke how his word declareth him to proceed in his workes, ſuch we may be ſure was his Purpoſe and Decree?] There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke it is as ſafe to diſpute the caſe whether God decreed to redeeme all. As whether he hath Redeemed all by Chriſt, therefore in this caſe this premiſe is but Empty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His expreſſes ſeeme to infeere, that only his Decrees or Election are in Chriſt, and for Chriſt; but this untrue, for all ſpirituall bleſſings are in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. but no Scripture ſaith that Gods Decrees are for Chriſt, of this may be ſeen more fully afterward.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What uſe this premiſe hath in purſuit of that publique place Chriſt ſtood in, and proving herefrom that he dyed for all and every man, It is not eaſie for any to determine, and I can count it no other but verboſity, that the Reader from multitude of words might conclude abundance of matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. [However Chriſt was figured by <hi>Adam</hi> in the common place he ſtood in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet there is a great difference between thoſe two <hi>Adams</hi> and their worke: the firſt was a living ſoule, might have ſtood, and all his with him, but no power to riſe and live againe, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was a quickning Spirit.] This premiſe might well have been ſpared, as I beleeve he will ſay in the cloſe. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I thinke there is none ſo blinded with his errour, as to thinke that Chriſt and <hi>Adam</hi> agree in all things as publique perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It being granted, yet I ſhall improve it to cleare theſe three particulars,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt as they are publique Perſons are not equall and alike in all things.</item>
                     <item>2. If we find not the particular things wherein they agree, and wherein they differ, much may be ſaid in this Point to little purpoſe.</item>
                     <item>3. That it deſerveth examination, whether the preciſe number of Individuals be not one thing, wherein they differ, and whatſoever is brought to prove it muſt not be the compariſon it ſelfe or publique place, but ſomething that proveth particularly that they agree in this, or elſe he ſaith nothing.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. [There is an abundance in Chriſt beyond that appearing in the Type, ſo that therein Chriſt commeth not ſhort, but goeth beyond the Figure in that wherein it figured him.] This is but one and the ſame with the former, for in that he ſaid, they were not alike in ſome things, he preſuppoſed that he went beyond in ſome things, and came ſhort in ſome things, or both. But,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="tcp:45603:48"/>1. That difference from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. I grant, by one offence ſin entered: But the Pardon is of many offences; But this giveth no light to the deciding of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, whether Chriſt procured Pardon for every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> or no?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for his ſecond, <hi>viz</hi> [Chriſt leadeth to a better life than <hi>Adam</hi> by Sin over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw,] I cannot aſſent unto, becauſe <hi>Adams</hi> integrity and holineſſe lead him to an eternall glory in heaven, and Chriſt leadeth to no more, and that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 19, 20. is abuſed by him being quoted to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the third, <hi>viz.</hi> [That the benefit of Chriſt redounds to more then the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> did damnifie,] Lyeth under a <hi>(non liquet,)</hi> for I conceive the Act of Chriſt as Mediatour is only reſtorative. Now in ſuch an Act how could he reſtore more then <hi>Adam</hi> hurt? None elſe needed Chriſt; I conceive by his Texts alleadged that he meaneth the Angels: But that they have any benefit by Chriſts reſtoring Act, or ſtood in need of any ſuch, his Scriptures prove not at all, for how Chriſt ſhould do Angels good, being in the nature of man, more then he could do man good in the nature of Angells, I ſee not: If Chriſt did Angells good it was in regard of their ſtability, but why Chriſt ſhould have a hand by way of merit in their ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, more than he ſhould have had in <hi>Adams</hi> ſtability if he had ſtood, I ſee not: But I ſuppoſe if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned there had been no place for Chriſts merits.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It deſerveth examination, Whether Chriſt may not come ſhort of his Figure in ſome things, as well as exceed in ſome things, and yet anſwer his Figure, and ſo his comming ſhort in the preciſe number of Individuals, and yet anſwer his Figure well enough? Not now to inſiſt upon the Impertinency to the Authors preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I ſhall examine the Compariſon it ſelfe, <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt as two publique Perſons, he urgeth thus:</p>
               <p>[The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in a publique place not ſingly for himſelfe alone, but in the roome of all mankind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only as they were in his loynes, but by vertue of the account and worke of God, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo what God did to him he did to all mankind: So the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in publique place, not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, or for ſome, but all mankind, all fallen; elſe had he been ſhort of his Figure, whereas God did more honour to Chriſt then <hi>Adam.</hi>] Herein we have the ſumme of the Argument, what is in it ſhall appeare, and firſt I ſhall ſhew wherein we agree, then wherein we differ, we agree in theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood as a publipue perſon not ſingly for himſelfe as one, but for others, ſo Chriſt as a publique perſon not for himſelfe but others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>Adam</hi> by vertue of his publique place ſtood in the roome of ſo many as God by vertue of that Covenant betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and God appointed he ſhould: So Chriſt ſtood in the roome of ſo many as God appointed in that Covenant betwixt him and Chriſt, thus farre we agree. But he would have them go one thus farre, that as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the roome of all that came from his Loines, ſo Chriſt as publique perſon ſhould ſtand in the roome of all that came from the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> Loines, and herein we differ; and as he ſaith, [As <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the roome of all that came from his Loines, ſo Chriſt ſtood in the roome of all that came from <hi>Adams</hi> Loines,] making the Analogie to run thus. So we ſay, That as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the roome of all that came from him, ſo Chriſt ſtood in the roome of all that have a being from himſelfe; And is not the Analogie betwixt Chriſt and his Figure as cleare and full in our Aſſertion
<pb facs="tcp:45603:48"/> as in his? So that though they for whom <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, and they for whom Chriſt ſtood, differ in the preciſe number, yet they agree <hi>(in aliquo tertio,)</hi> being both the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar iſſue from their owne root, receiving from the one death, the other life.</p>
               <p>This he hath no way to enervate but by affirming, [That <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the roome of mankind, not as becauſe they came from his Loines, for ſo they were after his fall, and loſſe therein of the vertue of that publique place, but by vertue of the Account, Covenant, agreement, betweene him and God,] Wherein we have his aſſertion it ſelfe, then the reaſons to backe it: The aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> [That <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the roome of mankind, not as or becauſe they came from his Loynes,] This is contrary,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To reaſon, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> as a root could propagate neither life nor death, but to ſuch as came from him and as ſo; to what can a root communicate either good or bad ſap but to ſuch branches as grow out of it ſelfe, by vertue of which comming out of it, it hath a meane to conveying ſuch to it as it hath it ſelfe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is contrary to all mens Judgements both dogmaticall, and polemicall, they all grant, that <hi>Adam</hi> was betruſted with no more than came from his Loines, but the teſtimony of the Remonſt. are the moſt convincing in this caſe;<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. This aſſertion is contrary to himſelfe, <hi>Pag.</hi> 119. where he ſaith, that [the firſt man was made a publique perſon in the roome and place of all mankind, to ſtand or fall for all that came from him by propagation;] what is this but to ſay that he was a publique perſon for them as comming from his Loines? So <hi>Pag.</hi> 48.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet further it apeares that he ſtood as a publique perſon for them, not as men, but as ſuch as came from his loynes, becauſe though Chriſt was truly man yet by vertue of his publike place, he neither had profited him if he had ſtood, nor did hurt him by his fall, did not convey ſin and death to him as to his poſterity, and the reaſon of this is becauſe he came from him not by propagation, but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall overſhadowing, and ſomething in his owne words there as to this purpoſe, <hi>Pag.</hi> 119. [He decreed that all the reſt of mankind ſhould come from this firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by propagation, except his Son Chriſt.] Having thus examined his aſſertion, I ſhall perpend his Reaſons and they are weake as that falſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, [For ſo they were after his fall,] arguing, that becauſe they came from him by propagation after his fall; therefore by his loines: ſtrong reaſoning! If our Author will not have it, becauſe they came from his loynes, it muſt be becauſe they were mankind: But is not reaſon as valid againſt this? thus, not as mankind, becauſe ſo they were after his fall? nay, doth it ſtrongly overthrow him, for ſeeing now after the fall men are his off-ſpring, and all ſuch, and none but
<pb facs="tcp:45603:49"/> ſuch as come from his Loynes are guilty of ſin and death, doth it not appeare that he was a publique perſon for all ſuch as came out of his Loynes, and under that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notion?</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon is this, [It was by vertue of the Covenant between God and <hi>Adam.</hi>] A fond and weake reaſon to oppoſe theſe two, and ſay, [not as comming from his Loynes, but by vertue of the Covenant,] they agree very well: and we may ſay twas for them as, or becauſe, they came from his loynes, becauſe it was the agreement betwixt God and <hi>Adam,</hi> that he ſtood as a publique perſon for himſelfe and his Poſterity, and ſuch as came from his Loynes: If he will beleeve any thing <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe, <hi>[Ratio faderis a Deo cum hominibus primis initi haec fuit, ut ſi ipſi ingratid permonerent, ad poſteros dona tranſmitterentur, ſi ſe indignos face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, poſteri vero <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in the room of all that came from his Loynes, and under that very notion; And then the Analogie will come to this, even ſo doth Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſtand in the roome of all thoſe that come to have a being from him; And if the Author would have it driven any further he muſt prove it: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he would fain conclude as [In this his publique place he is not betruſted with fewer than <hi>Adam.</hi>] And he would prove by ſuch Arguments, [Elſe will he come ſhort of his Figure.] But this is no convincing Argument; for firſt it is no paradox to ſay that in ſome things Chriſt comes ſhort of his Figure, for in our Authors Judgement they are not alike in all things. Now in the rules of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, it is no more diſcrepant to come ſhort than to exceed: And upon this ground that can be no reaſon againſt his comming ſhort in this particular, becauſe he is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Figure; for this notwithſtanding he may exceed and go beyond, in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Judgement. Secondly, If he ſtand in the roome of all them that come to have a being from him, he anſwers his Figure that ſtood in the roome of all that had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, although he did not ſtand in the roome of every Individuall, or the preciſe number of Individualls. And if a part of Scripture did affirme that unleſſe Chriſt ſtood in the roome of the preciſe number of Individualls, he ſhould come ſhort of his Figure, I ſhould yeeld to him in this point, but till then he muſt give me leave to thinke this Reaſon of no force.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Reaſon by which he proveth it is this, [God honoured Chriſt more then <hi>Adam.</hi>] True, and herein, <hi>Adam</hi> was a root of Life and Death, life if he had ſtood, and death if he fell: But Chriſt was to convey only life, herein Chriſt was more honoured than <hi>Adam.</hi> But the honour of Chriſt is not placed in the preciſe number of them for whom he ſtood, ſo as that he that ſtands in the room God ſhould honour moſt, for then in that God honoured Chriſt more than <hi>Adam,</hi> it muſt follow that Chriſt ſtood in the place and roome of more than <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, or that came from his Loines, which is abſurd.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond particular which he obſerveth in this Similitude betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>Pag.</hi> 44. is not pertinent or uſefull to the Controverſie at all, therefore I ſhall wave it.</p>
               <p>A third which he obſerveth is the [Effect and fruit of this publique buſineſſe, It was publique, and concerned all mankind, the diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> overthrew all mankind, ſo as in and by him they were all
<pb facs="tcp:45603:49"/> deprived of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the obedience of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and reſtored all mankind, ſo as in him they are reſtored, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and made righteous.] It matters not what comes from the Authors Pen, but what proceeds from the mouth of Scripture; but this no Scripture ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No Scripture ſpeaketh that <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the roome of all mankind, that is, of every individuall man, the Author confeſſeth that he ſtood not in the roome of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adams</hi> ſin loſt not every man, he loſt not Chriſt himſelfe, but only ſuch as came of him by propagation, which Chriſt did not: both theſe particulars are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, if not denyed, by him, though contrary to himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No Scripture ſaith, That as <hi>Adam</hi> loſt all that came from his Loynes, ſo Chriſt recovered all that came from the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> Loynes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. No Scripture ſaith, that Chriſts recovery concerned all that came out of <hi>Adams</hi> Loynes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Scripture no where ſaith, that if as <hi>Adams</hi> loſſe concerned all that came from his Loynes, ſo Chriſts recovery muſt concerne all that came from <hi>Adams</hi> Loynes, rather the contrary: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. [All dyed in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive.] The All in the former part is <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that came from him: but the All in the ſecond part, is not all that came from the firſt, but the ſecond <hi>Adam, Verſ</hi> 23. Firſt Chriſt, and then Chriſts at his comming. So that what is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſpoken the Author ſpeaketh, but not Scripture; he produceth ſome places, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.24, 22. where it ſaith, All are juſtified, and the righteouſneſſe of God on (All) but herein he diabolically clippes the Text willfully, leaveth out that which would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Controverſie, it is not all that came from <hi>Adams</hi> Loynes, but all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. [Free gift came on all men to Juſtification of life.] True, but it is on the All that is mentioned <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.22, 24. as may appeare by the 17. <hi>verſe,</hi> it ſaith, not on all <hi>Adams</hi> Sons, or all that came from <hi>Adams</hi> Loynes.</p>
               <p>A fourth particular which he obſerveth from this compariſon is this, in regard of the vertue and operation of this publique buſineſſe, thus; [When any commeth to have a being from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> they do neceſſarily in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his nature partake of the guilt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So when any do come by a ſpirituall birth to have a being in Chriſt, in that participation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He now freely imputeth it to them,] This being well conſidered will ſhew his weakeneſſe, and the truth at once: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How is it that every man in and by partaking of <hi>Adams</hi> nature, and comming from him, partaketh of the guilt, if he ſtood not as a publique for mankind as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from his Loynes, which he even now denyed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. I demand, Why thoſe that come to have a being from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> partake of his guilt and miſery, is it not becauſe he ſtood in their roome? And is it upon this ground, that as it was intended in his ſtanding in publique, ſo it taketh place in them that partake of his nature: And as they that come to partake of his nature come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his ſin, becauſe he ſtood in the roome of them that ſhould partake of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; So muſt it not <hi>A pari</hi> follow, if a reaſon being demanded why them that have a being from Chriſt come to partake of his righteouſneſſe? Is it not to be anſwered, becauſe he ſtood a publique perſon for them? What is this but to averre, that as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood a publique perſon for all his: So did Chriſt for all his, and all that were to have a being from him. Which falleth ſhort of what the Author intendeth, and what
<pb facs="tcp:45603:50"/> he hath obtained in all this purſuance of this Compariſon, only thus much appeares, that herein they agreed, both conveyed their proper influence to them that came of them, but they did both to the preciſe number of Individuals, he proveth not in one word of his Diſcourſe, nor one place of Scripture. And all this, and all that which followeth being of the ſame ſtampe with what went before, riſeth not ſo high, as to prove that Chriſt obtained life for all that came from the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> Loynes.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That God made the Creatures for man, yea ſo loved him that though he was fallen, yet he would worke out a Redemption and procure life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is for men that were made by him, as his Creatures, not a part but the whole.] And herein is the top of the Authors reaſon in this Chapter: But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How doth the Author prove, that either in 3. or 4. <hi>verſes</hi> of <hi>John</hi> 1. the Text mentioneth the worke of Redemption, I conceive he cannot prove it to ſpeake of any thing but Creation: No not <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. [In him was life and that was the light of men;] ſpeakes only thus much, that in the Word there was life, even when he made the world, and that life was the light of men, from that life came the light of men: and till he make this cleare, this Text ſerves him not.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:45603:50"/>2. Grant this, yet doth the joynt mention in the Text argue an equality of exten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Let us then follow this rule, and ſay from <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. [The world was made by him, and the world knew him not.] What doth this leſſe inferre than this, That the world that knew him not was as large as the world that was made by him? but this is falſe, if any at all in thoſe times knew him, which Scripture tells us there did. So from <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.18. [By him were all things Created, and he is the head of his Body;] We may ſay his Body and Headſhip is as large as his Creatures, or the things that were Created by him, this would be ſtrange reaſoning, and of the ſame mould is his inference fron <hi>John</hi> 1.2, 3, 4. But if he had minded the Text he might have ſeen ſome thing againſt this Inference, for ſpeaking of Creation, it ſaith, (All things) were Created by him: but in the other it ſaith, that light was the life of (Men,) and if it come ſhort in this, it may come ſhorter; yet no violence to the joynt mention of Creation, and Redemption.</p>
               <p>Againe, Speaking of the recovery of Man, and of the Creatures to their purity for mans uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he thus ſpeaketh,] [And is not all this affirmed in the Goſpell, where Creation and Redemption are mentioned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 20. And where this generall tearme (All things) is mentioned in Creation, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. Reconciliation, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. and what leſſe doth this inferre, then that the peace wrought for mankind, is as large as Creation and Preſervation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?] I willingly acknowledge with his Query, that nothing can be leſſe ſeene in thoſe places than that; For where it ſpeakes of Creation it takes in the fallen Angels, and the reſt of the Creatures: but where it ſpeaketh of Reconciliation it cannot. For the fallen Angels I know the Author will ſay he never did reconcile, and for the reſt of the Creatures it is not ſutable to Scripture to ſay he reconciled them; He created the bruit Beaſts, but Scripture no where ſaid that he reconciled the bruit Creatures, for whom he reconciled he dyed for, but Scripture ſaith no where that he dyed for bruit Creatures; he being in the nature of men, dyed only for men, and reconciled only men, and ſo from that place it doth appeare that the (All things) Created, and the (All things) Reconciled are not of the ſame latitude and extent.</p>
               <p>That which is of moment is in <hi>Pag.</hi> 52. as followeth, [In that Creation is uſed as an Argument to induce us to Faith and Confidence, <hi>Job</hi> 10.8, 13. and 14.14. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 129.16, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16. And coupled with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in this buſineſſe, <hi>Iſay</hi> 43.1. Now if he hath not wrought a Redemption as large as mankind created by him, what force can there be in this Argument grounded on his Creation?] The worke of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed is uſed as an argument of a threefold duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of uprightneſſe, as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139.16, 17. and this is ſuch as every man may uſe, I am his Creature therefore I ought to ſerve him uprightly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of prevailing in Prayer to move God to take away his hand, becauſe we are his Creatures and not able to endure his hand. So <hi>Job</hi> 10.8, 13. And with this ſometimes God is moved; The extravagancies of their lives, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103.9, 14, 15. But this is ſuch an argument as every one cannot urge, as if God was alwaies moved towards every one that he made, he may do much for his Children becauſe they are weake Creatures.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb facs="tcp:45603:51"/>3. Of confidence in Gods power, and ability to ſave, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.9, 10, 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Argument thus framed, he is as able to ſave us as to create us: But all theſe are nothing to his purpoſe, becauſe the worke of Redemption is not in any of thoſe places joyned with Creation; And I never obſerved that the Creation is uſed as an Argument to perſwade us of Gods willingneſſe to ſave, as if he would ſave becauſe he did Create, much leſſe that he maketh Creation an Argument to perſwade us of Redemption, as if he would Redeeme us becauſe hee Created us.</p>
               <p>But where both are joyned together, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1. there is a perfect Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of his Power and Will, but his Power is drawne from the Creation, and his Will from Redemption. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. He is able becauſe Creator, willing becauſe faithfull. Now theſe are Arguments that his owne Children may make, and to perſwade them of his Power to ſave (which is common) may uſe the Creation which is common, and to perſwade them of his willingneſſe, which is peculiar, they uſe his Redemption, and what of all this? It doth not yet inferre Redemption to bee as large as Creation, for the All Created goeth beyond the All Redeemed: And the more the Reader obſerveth, the more he ſhall ſee of the Authors weakeneſſe herein; force enough is there in Creation to evince Gods Power, although his Redemption be not ſo large.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the constant changeing of the perſon, when having mentioned the generall, it mentioneth the eſpeciall.</head>
               <p>THe Author his ſcope in this Chapter, is to make it appeare that thoſe places that are produced by us, with applicative reſtriction, are nothing againſt him; being ſuch as treat of the ſpeciall favours of beleivers, which is not the buſineſſe he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of, and this he doth by ſuggeſtion to his reader: that where the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ranſome and redemption wrought in him, it ſpeakes in generall termes, but where it ſpeaketh of choice benefits, it ſpeakes in applicative expreſſions.</p>
               <p>But when I prove theſe three particulars that follow, this will prove invalid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture uſeth not this method in thoſe Scriptures which he urgeth, and his Scriptures are theſe, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. where he ſaith [Reconciling is to the (world) and that is the redemption wrought in him: and ver. 21. He was made ſinne for us; there is the ſpeciall benefit of believers] wherein he intimated theſe two things. 1 That the word (reconciling) in the 19 verſe is meant of Chriſts act as Mediatour, working out a reconciliation with God for men, but this is a <hi>non probatum.</hi> I ſhewed the contrary in the foregoing part of this diſcourſe: that word both 18 and 19 verſes, whether to be underſtood of Gods actuall reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe to us, not imputing our ſinnes, or his reconciling us to himſelfe: it is to be meant of the application of his death, and the choice benefits of beleivers, as is confeſſed by him elſewhere; yet this is ſaid to be the (world) that is men living in the world 2. He would have hence, that ver. 21. [He hath made him to be ſinne for us.] ſpeaketh of the choice benefits of beleivers; this I approve not; but minde him of theſe two things. 1. His ſelfe-contradictions; for when he was treating of the firſt redemption, for all, and as wrought in Chriſt, page 4. he produceth this place to prove it, and here ſpeaking of the ſecond which is applicative to beleivers, be brings this place to prove it, we may ſee with what judgement the Author ſpeaketh. 2. This phraſe plainely denoteth the death of Chriſt and redemption wrought by it; for to (die for) and (to be made ſinne for) are termes of the ſame ſignification, yet this is ſaid to be for (us) and not in generall termes. Nay it is plaine, that the firſt words ſpeake of the death of Chriſt, and the ſecond <hi>viz.</hi> [That we might be made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God] denote the application; but here is no change of perſon: both in the ſame; he made him ſinne for (us) that (we) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore his device on this place falleth.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.5. Speaking of that which he did for all, he ſaith, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them that were under the Law; but ſpeaking of the eſpeciall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Adoption he changeth the perſon, and ſaith, that we might receive the adoption of ſonnes] wherein he would them, the firſt words to be without a reſtriction, and in generall termes; but he doth not here, nor elſewhere prove it, in redeeming them that receive the Adoption; he redeemed them that were under the Law, and the Text ſaith not that he redeemed all that were under the law.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:45603:52"/>2. He ſuppoſeth that adoption is a more ſpeciall benefit then redemption, which the Apoſtle owneth not; he puts as great emphaſis and dignity on the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both ſpirituall bleſſings, with which he bleſſeth Beleivers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. So for the reſt of his texts, they are a little invalid: and let the ſober-minded reader view thoſe texts in his ſenſe. He reconcileth every man, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God: He redeemed every man under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſonnes. He ſuffered for all unjuſt, that he might bring us to God; is this a probable interpretation? as if that God, that he might bring ſome to God, ſhould redeeme and reconcile all, and then view them in our ſenſe. He reconciled us, being men living in the world, that we might be the righteouſneſſe of God in him; he redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us being under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons, he ſuffered for us being unjuſt, that he might bring us to God. And now let the reader judge which is moſt commodious, and if this ſecond, then any may ſee both parts relateth to the ſame perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture doth not onely not follow that method in theſe cited places, but alſo in other places, as <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.15. 1 <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe it was ſo, yet the one is but to explaine the other, as, He hath ſuffered for the unjuſt, that is for us unjuſt, that he might being us to God; ſo that his invented me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod herein, and arguments thereon fall to the ground.</p>

               <p>HEre we are come to the grand Text of difference, where Chriſt is ſaid to give himſelfe a [Ranſome for all men.] Now to the tranſaction of this Text, I ſhall place the controverſie onely about the phraſe [all men] and the reader may know that the author would have it meant, <hi>[de ſingulis generûm]</hi> as to take in every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of every kind. We on the other ſide, would have it meant <hi>[de generibus ſingulorum,]</hi> ſo as to take in onely all the ſorts and kinds of men, and herein ſtands the controverſie about this Text: now how ſtrongly he proveth his interpretation, it is my next taske to examine. And herein he hath a threefold field to runne in, <hi>viz.</hi> the force of the words themſelves, the circumſtances, the ſcope of the Text; and he think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s all theſe and every one of theſe is ſufficient to evince it, that this Text is to be underſtood of all Adams ſons. Firſt he ſaith,</p>
               <p>[For the ſenſe of the word it ſelfe (All,) appeareth to be meant of Adam and all his ſonnes, becauſe the oppoſition is betweene God and men.]</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſenſe of the word it ſelfe cannot carry it to that meaning, becauſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelfe confeſſeth that the word (All) is many wayes taken, ſo as not to take in every of Adams ſonnes, as page 30. Therefore that word or phraſe that is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to be meant of all and every ſonne of Adam, or of ſome, or in a ſenſe not ſo large, cannot of it ſelfe be any convincing argument of its owne ſignification; in any place the matter treated of muſt adminiſter light herein, as the Author confeſſeth page 31.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45603:52"/> Neither is that plea of the (oppoſition betwixt God and men) of any force; by this phraſtologie he meaneth when God is ſaid to doe any thing for man, or men, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, then it meaneth all Adams ſonnes; but this is very empty; when Chriſt is ſaid to draw all men to him, doth it take in every ſonne of Adam, and when 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. The Apoſtle ſaith, (all men ſhall have praiſe of God) doth this take in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams ſonnes? and will he follow his abſurd reaſoning and ſay. [Every man, ſo all were created by him, every man, and all that have being from Adam, and ſo his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being men, &amp;c.] with many ſuch frothy expreſſions as he doth. page 55. How would this wrack the Scripture, and ſo in page 56. He purſues this phraſe (All men) with the many acceptations of it, but to ſmall purpoſe he ſhowes that ſometimes it is taken for all Adams ſonnes, and ſometimes not, but this is not wiſely inſerted here, he affirming that the ſenſe of the word it ſelf will carry it to all Adams ſons. And he gives us ſome occaſion to thinke that he hath deſerted this ſenſe of the word, and hath found out another more probable but leſſe propitious to his doctrine: in the end of page 56. the Reader may obſerve he hath changed the face of his aſſertion, and in that the queſtion. For in page 55. he giveth it thus: [this word all, meaneth Adam and all his ſonnes.] But in page 56. he gives it thus, [All men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. principally is meant of naturall men, ſinners, ſonnes of Adam, unbeleevers, unregenerate men. He would hereby inſinuate to his unwary reader that we deny, and he is to prove that Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſome for naturall men, ſonnes of Adam, ſinners; when he and all know that it is his taske to prove, and his former aſſertion that he gave himſelfe a ranſome for All [naturall men,] [All Adams ſonnes,] [all ſinners,] this is no faire dealing, but egregious and unjuſtifiable diſſimulation, and all thoſe reaſons in the former part of page 57. being onely to prove the reverſed face of his aſſertion, are impertinent and not worth reciting; yet we may ſee his groſſe and bold impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that after he had propounded the place, as meant of [naturall men] [ſonnes of Adam] [ſinners] without this particle, All, and proves no more: yet page 57. he ſhameleſſely triumpheth. That it appeareth that the words (All men,) are meant of Adam and all his ſonnes; it is too frequent with him to carry all in his concluſion, and nothing in his premiſes. Having thus fruitleſly traverſed the firſt field of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſenſe of the words (All men;) he ſteps in to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Text that attend theſe words; he produceth many circumſtances as followes.</p>
               <p>[1.

But to this I ſay, (though it may be queſtioned,) I ſhall grant it, that all in the firſt verſe, for whom we are to pray, is of the ſame extent with the all, in ver. 6. for whom Chriſt was a ranſome; this proveth not that (All men) ver. 6. taketh in all Adams ſonnes, becauſe the All in ver. 1. doth not ſo. But will ſome ſay, are we not to pray for Adams ſonnes? I anſwer, in ſome caſes not;

And all that the Author inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, I grant; he bids beleevers to pray for all men, but this is to repeate, not prove, or however to prove <hi>Idem per Idem,</hi> as to ſay, All men, is to be underſtood of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams ſonnes, becauſe it ſaith all men; excellent probation. And whereas he ſaith, [It ſaith not of all ſorts ſome, but all men;] it is unworthy the nameing, ſo I may ſay: it ſaith not [all Adams ſonnes, every individuall, but all men] it ſaith neither [of all ſorts ſome] nor [all of every ſort] but uſeth a phraſe that will admit either meaning; now this is the queſtion which is meant? let the Text determine: it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not into Individuals, as <hi>[Nero, Caeſar,] &amp;c.</hi> but into kinds; as [Kings and ſuch as are in authority under them:] becauſe all ſorts were ordained to be uſefull to the Church; and he inſtanceth in Kings, becauſe they have the greateſt influence into the growth of the Goſpel; therefore it is probable, that though he ſay (All men) he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth [All ſorts of men.] And whereas he ſaith, [naming but one ſort, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaith all of them,] it is an expreſſe falſity; he ſaith not for (All Kings) but all ſuch as are in authority under them: that is, all degrees or kindes of power under Kings: But he attempteth to anſwer objections, page 57. the firſt whereof is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, the ſecond is worth examining.</p>

Indeed it maketh him to ceaſe being one of that all which we are to pray for; but then, doth it not clearely evince that, the phraſe (All men) doth not take in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſonne of Adam? for, if the Church or a beleever may pray for all men, and ſo obey the Apoſtles command, though one or many be left out that have ſinned unto death, what is more cleare then that the All in ver. 1. doth not take in every individuall ſon of Adam?</p>
               <div type="section">

But beſides, he is miſtaken herein; the buſineſſe here inſiſted on, is not praying for enemies as well as friends, as <hi>Math.</hi> 5.44.48. For this they might doe, and yet leave the Apoſtles command unſatisfied of praying for Kings: we may pray for many friends and enemies, yet pray for no Kings; but were it ſo, he moſt know, 1.

For if we are to pray but for ſome unconverted and enemies, it is requiſite that we pray without wrath or doubting, becauſe wrath and doubting are as incident to us praying for ſome as for all, ſo that thoſe ſome be enemies to us. But againe by wrath and doubting, it may be queſtioned, whether they be referred to God, that is without wrath, a fooliſh charging of God if he deferre to heare us; and doubting of his faithfulneſſe or power to helpe us: and if thus, this is not only requiſite for beleevers praying one for another, but to be an ingredient in all their prayers of what nature ſoever.</p>

Beſides from the matter prayed for, it appeareth not that by all men, is meant every ſonne of Adam, becauſe every ſonne of Adam hath not an influence into the godly and quiet lives of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtate, or any beleivers in any ſtate or government.</p>

                  <head>The Sixth circumstance.</head>
                  <p>[By the manner of mentioning them that are to be prayed for. All men, Kings, men in authority, of which very few Beleivers, &amp;c.] The author muſt know that wee are to pray for Kings, not as beleevers, or unbeleivers, but as Kings; as they are in eminent place and rule, and ſo have an influence in our holy lives, whether beleevers or unbeleevers: beſides he can infer hence but this, that we are to pray for unbeleiving Kings, but this proveth not that we are to pray for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſonne of Adam. Yet he confidently concludeth it of his ſide, but it is his boldneſſe that preſumes, not his reaſon that proveth; he hath produced many circumſtances, but yet they are ſo rudely applied to this buſineſſe, that the expreſſions ſpent about them, cannot but be tedious to the intelligent, becauſe they have not the leaſt ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove that the (all men,) mentioned either in the 1.4. or 6. verſe, does take in all Adams ſons. Having ſpoke of the ſenſe of the words themſelves, the circumſtances that attend them; he comes to the third ſort and rank of proofes, and that is from the ſcope of the Text, and he thus ſpeaketh.</p>
                  <p>[From the 1. to the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, no further thing is mentioned but what belongs to all men to heare, and what Chriſt hath done for all: and what we are indebted to all men. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14.15.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44.] And this I conclude from page 61. is the ſcope of the Text which he hints of, but let the Reader well obſerve, the vanity of this laſt, will ſeem as great as the former. For the buſineſſe that he is to prove, is that (all men) comprehendeth in it every ſonne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; and this he proveth from the ſcope of the Text, which ſpeaketh of nothing but what belongeth to all men: So that this is the dint of his reaſon (all men) taketh in every individuall man, becauſe the Text ſaith (all men;) the ſtrength of his reaſon is admirable. If he had ſaid the Text treates of ſuch things as belong to ever individuall ſonne of Adam, then he had ſaid to the purpoſe, but that I feare upon examination would want weight; therefore it is as good to ſpeake that which is impertinent, as that which is to the purpoſe, and not be able to prove it. And if he had ſaid ſo, let us view the method of this new diſputer; his affirmative is, that Chriſt gave himſelfe a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45603:54"/> ranſome for all Adams ſonnes, and he proves this by the Text, 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. And being asked how he proveth that Text ſpeaketh of all Adams ſonnes, he ſaith becauſe that ſpeaketh of ſuch things as are common to all Adams ſonnes; and ſo in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle he may runne <hi>(in infinitum)</hi> but further to explaine the ſcope of the Text, he thus ſaith.</p>
                  <p>[It appeares to be a laying downe of the Goſpel, as it is to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to every creature.] That it is a truth of the goſpel which is to be preached, I deny not; but that the intention and ſcope of the Apoſtle, is to lay downe a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of the Goſpel to be preached, is no way evident; the ſcope is to move beleevers to pray, as he confeſſeth, page 28. But admit it, yet it followeth not that that phraſe all men, extendeth to every individuall; for then it muſt follow, that to ſay, [Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome for every individuall man] is Goſpel; but where proveth he that? I know he will ſay from this Text of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. Still all muſt come to that iſſue, it is Goſpel becauſe 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. ſo ſaith, and that Text ſaith ſo becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Goſpel, and this is ſtill like the authors reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>[2. It is laid downe as a ground of praying for all men.] True, and ſo we grant that Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſome for all; and what is he better? he leaves the queſtion untouched in all this large diſcourſe; he proveth not yet this Text commands us to pray for every individuall ſonne of Adam: but grant it, yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in ſtrict reaſoning, that the all in ver. 6. muſt be ſo large; for in his owne divinity, the one being an act that man is to doe, (pray) and the other an act that Chriſt doth (give a ranſome) this diverſity of matter treated, will admit of a divers ſignification of [all men;] but beſides Chriſts giving himſelfe a ranſome for ſome of all ſorts, is ground enough for us to pray for every man of all ſorts; therefore our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all men doth not argue (all men) in the 6. verſe to take in all Adams ſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third thing (after many ſubſervient particulars in page 60.) which hath the moſt probability of reaſon is this, [Herein he ſheweth the will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the mediatour and men; and what he would have him doe, <hi>viz.</hi> Save all men, and free them from the neceſſity of periſhing;] which was formerly laid downe and anſwered in the Third circumſtance: onely here is an expreſſion ſcattered which I aſſent not to, that freedome from the neceſſity of periſhing onely is here brought to expound the word, Save, but this I diſprove thus. Thoſe which actually periſh, are not in Scripture phraſe ſaid to be ſaved. But ſuch as doe periſh, may be freed from the neceſſity of periſhing; therefore they that are only freed from the neceſſity of periſhing, are not ſaid to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>But to the thing in hand; as for that Text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. I finde no Text in all the Scripture ſo toſt up and downe with variety of interpretations as that Text. As (1.) That he willeth ſome of all ſorts. (2.) He willeth all to be ſaved, that is, all that are ſaved, are ſaved becauſe he willeth it to be ſo; Soe <hi>Lombard,</hi>

That he willeth it, <hi>(voluntate figni)</hi> by thoſe things that are the ſignes of his will, as his commands, promiſes, threatnings, but not by his will of decree. (4.

The Spirit maketh requeſts, that is it helpeth us to make requeſts. (5.) That God earneſtly wiſheth and deſires that all ſhould be ſaved eternally, and he gives them all meanes conducing thereunto. (6.) He willeth all ſhall be ſaved, that is, brought to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45603:55"/> the knowledge of the Goſpel which is called ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. (7.) All to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that they ſhould be made ſalvable: the firſt five are all cited by that great Jeſuite, <hi>Cornel. a Lapid. in locum,</hi> and their ſeverall authors; the laſt is his owne, the foure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he rejecteth, his owne he explaineth not, nor ſaith plainely that he willeth the ſalvation of every individuall, or however proveth not unleſſe by ver. 6. Becauſe Chriſt is ſaid to give himſelfe a ranſome for all men, quite contrary to our author; the one cleareth the 4. by 6. verſe, the other the 6. by 4. verſe, but I thinke both amiſſe, for he that proveth the one by the other (which way ſoever) proveth <hi>[ignotum per igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum]</hi> an obſcure phraſe by a phraſe of the ſame obſcurity; and till the buſineſſe be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleared, I conclude, that that phraſe (all men) in any of theſe verſes, is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent witneſſe either for it ſelfe, ot for its neighbour. And the laſt of the ſeven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations the author faſtens upon as the ſenſe of the Text, though againſt all Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters: and the language of the Scripture; but if he be asked how he proveth it, that the word (ſaved) is meant to make them ſalvable, he hath this method at hand, he proveth it by this Text, becauſe it is ſaid to be to all Adams ſonnes: and if he be asked how he proveth that, this Text ſpeaketh of ſuch a ſalvation that is common to all Adams ſons, he proveth it by this, becauſe the Text ſpeakes of what Chriſt doth for all men, <hi>viz.</hi> make them ſalvable, and from ſuch circles in his reaſonings all along, hee is not able by an eaſie exorciſme to free himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>As for his objection which he pretendeth to anſwer, if he had not deviſed a too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd frame of it, the weakeneſſe of his anſwer had beene very evident; I ſhall frame it for him, and the drift of it is this, to prove that the phraſe [All men] vet. 6. is not proved by [all men] in the firſt verſe to be taken in ſuch a generall ſenſe, but rather the firſt verſe proveth, that the ſixth verſe cannot take in every ſon of Adam, and the argument is this.</p>
                  <p>The all that are to be prayed for, is as large as the all he ranſomed.</p>
                  <p>But the all to be prayed for, taketh not in all the ſons of Adam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> the all he ranſomed, taketh not in all the ſons of Adam.</p>
                  <p>To this he anſwereth, [This argument hath no force, <hi>Paul</hi> directeth to pray for all men, and <hi>John</hi> ſheweth how long we are to pray for ſome.] But this anſwer hath leſſe force in it; for, all that he ſaith being granted, yet further I demand, whether when we know any to ſinne unto death and ſo pray not for them, we cannot fulfil the command of God, in praying for all men? certainely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>John</hi> doth not overthrow the command of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> both may be obeyed, but both cannot of the (all men.) in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. take in all Adams ſons, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is firme thus. If we fulfil the Apoſtles command of praying for (all men) when yet we pray not for every ſonne of Adam, then that phraſe (all men) doth not take in every ſon of Adam.</p>
                  <p>But the former is true. <hi>Ergo</hi> the latter is true alſo.</p>
                  <p>This propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> [The all to be prayed for, is as large as the all he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ranſome for] he diſavoweth; and the abſurdities which he ſaith follow are not worth naming; and any may wonder why he ſhould not receive this propoſition; for in page 57. 58. he contendeth that the (all men) to be prayed for, taketh in it every ſonne of Adam: and ſure I am that the all ranſomed is not nor can be any more then all. And how the author acquitteth himſelfe in this Text let any judge. So that if it be asked, how many Chriſt died or gave himſelfe a ranſome for: we may without equivocation and falſe gloſſe anſwer with the text for (all men) but we ſhall be guilty of both if we ſay, for every ſon of Adam, for that the text meaneth not, nor ſaith.</p>

               <p>AS for the perſons to whom the Epiſtle was writ, the occaſion of writing, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon writing, the reaſon why his name is concealed, &amp;c. are ſuch circumſtances as no way cometh within the verge of our enquiry; in this point I ſhall conſider the words from which he fetcheth ſo much ſtrength to his doctrine as he conceiveth: in ſo much as he makes it a champion text in his frontiſpiece to defend the whole work.</p>
               <p>His words are theſe.</p>
               <p>[That by the grace of God he might taſte death for every man.] The whole verſe is thus, being directly rendred from the Originall. [We ſee Jeſus made little lower then the Angels, through the ſuffering of death, crowned with honour and glory, that by the grace of God, &amp;c.] Now here are two things affirmed of Chriſt. Firſt, that he was made a little lower then the Angels. Secondly, that through death he was crowned with honour and glory; now it would give ſome light into the after words, if we could tell on which of theſe two they depend, or to which they relate: I muſt confeſſe it very obſcure; The Author page 65. ſeemes to make them relate to both, as if he was made little lowet then the Angels, that he might taſte death; and alſo crowned with honour and glory, becauſe he taſted death for every man; but this leaſt probable; for then the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> muſt ſignifie both, <hi>(ut)</hi> and <hi>(quia)</hi> both (that) and (becauſe) which is not likely; but let the dependance be what it will: for the words themſelves, I propound theſe following Queries. Firſt, whether theſe words [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] be well rendred thus. [That by the grace of God he might taſte death for every man.] And whether it may not beare this reading, [That by the grace of God he might taſte of every death, or <hi>(de tota morte)</hi> of all or whole death:] That he might taſte <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This reading I ſhall cleare to be no way contrary to the Scripture or Grammaticall conſtruction; then that the context clearely leadeth to it; the moſt forcible objection from Grammer, is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being a verbe of ſenſe, governeth a genitive caſe without <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But although this be true, yet it is well knowne that this language delights in ſuch pleonaſmes, and redundancy of prepoſitions is the elegancy of this language, when yet the word will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the genetive caſe without them.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, that if it had been ſo meant, the words would have been thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but to this I anſwer; that in the chapter there are two, and in the verſe one preſident, for placing the verbe between the adjective or relative, and the ſubſtantive.</p>
               <p>And the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is often for <hi>totus</hi> not <hi>omnis:</hi> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> whole death: ſo that here is not one word rendred but juſtifiably by Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly this is moſt agreeing with the context; for if the Author will have theſe words to relate to his [being made lower then the Angels, and ſuffering death,] it very
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45603:56"/> well agreeth thereto; for, if it be asked why he ſuffered ſuch a death, which death is not confined to the perfective act, when his ſoule was ſeparated from his body, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to all the acts of his humiliation, from his incarnation, to his expiration; for ſo all this was the death for which he was crowned, as appeareth, <hi>Phil</hi> 2.7.8, 9. His taking on him the forme of a ſervant, as well as his ſubmitting to the croſſe, was that which got him that name; now if it be asked why he ſuffered ſuch a death, of ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and extent, it was that he might taſte <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of whole death, both top and dregs, no part of that death we lie under ſhall be untaſted off. Or if we will have them relate to thoſe words, [He was crowned with honour,] it well agreeth with them; for if the queſtion be asked how he came to be crowned with honour and glory as he now is; the anſwer is not to be given, or the cauſe fetched from the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the perſons for whom he was humbled, becauſe his firſt act of humiliation, <hi>viz.</hi> his taking our nature upon him, was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for every man for whom he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward died; and if the ground of his glory was drawne from the latitude of perſons for whom he ſuffered, his Father had as good ground to glorifie him at his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as at his expiration, but that he did not: but the ground is fetched from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſufferings; when he had taken our nature on him, and undergone a ſeries and method of ſufferings in his life, and the dregs of all at his death, and ſo drunke his potion, and done his worke by taſting <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of all or whole death; then and therefore he was crowned; having ſo much ſuffered, he entred into glory; and ſo we ſee it well agreeing with the words foregoing.</p>
               <p>And it well agreeth with the words that follow. [For it behooved him &amp;c. to make the Captaine of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings.] Now that word (For) ſheweth that this 10. verſe relateth to the 9. and that he did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Nay, further we finde verſe 17. that [it behooved him to be like unto us in all things.] ſtill expounding his being perfect in ſufferings, that is when he hath ſufferings that we were lyable to, and ſo might know how to helpe us in all afflictions, he being like to us <gap reason="foreign">

This I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine not, but deſire the Author to tranſmit it to his oracle; and I leave it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learned: and if it be found congruous, then this Text maketh but little for him.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the Conſideration of like Scriptures ſpeaking in like manner.</head>
               <p>HIs drift in this Chapter, is to borrow ſome ſtrength from other Scriptures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that it is the ordinary language of Scripture, and not of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. therefore his ſeverall Texts I ſhall examine.</p>
               <p>[2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes.] This text I have formerly treated of in my ſecond Chapter, and there ſhowne that this Text favoureth him not for two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe this Text ſpeaketh of the application of the blood of Chriſt, as I have ſhowne by foure particulars in the ſecond Chapter, to which I referre the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which the Author is very averſe to, and ſtrongly denieth, but weakely diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. His reaſons why this meaneth not of the application by his ſpirit is twofold; [1. It ſaith not God will be reconciling the world to himſelfe, as ſpeaking of the worke of his Spirit;] as if no worke of God upon the hearts of men by his Spirit was done and paſt, ſo that it might not be ſaid he was ſo working; certainely he had reconciled many mens hearts to himſelfe by the Goſpel, long before the Apoſtle ſpoke theſe words; ſo that though he ſpake of that act of his ſpirit, he might ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God was reconciling; therefore this is no convincing argument. [2. It ſaith not God was in the world reconciling, as if he ſpake of the application in the hearts of men.] Neither is it ſo to be meant [in Chriſt] as if God working in the heart of Chriſt. But in Chriſt, as no more then [by Chriſt] and [for Chriſt] but this phraſe is as ſuitable to the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his blood, as well as the procurement by his blood, if the Apoſtle ſay true, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. If all ſpirituall bleſſings be given us in him, then ſurely reconcileing our hearts, being one, is alſo in him, and in verſe 10. he plainely ſaith, that the faithfull are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in one in Chriſt: therefore though it ſaith not in the world, but in Chriſt, it may well be meant of the application of Chriſts blood in the hearts of men.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:45603:57"/>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon why this place favoureth him not, is; Becauſe though it did ſpeake of the Act of Chriſt as mediatour procuring reconciliation; yet it doth not ſay for all, or every ſonne of Adam, but for the world: which phraſe is taken in Scripture not ſo largely, as 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.19. [The whole world lieth in wickedneſſe;] this cannot take in every ſonne of Adam, becauſe may are affirmed to be of God in the ſame verſe, and ſo not to ſinne, however not to lie in ſinne. So <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.6. though the Goſpel brought forth fruite in all the world, yet not in every ſonne of Adam, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. beleeved on in the world, but not of every ſonne of Adam, but men living in the world.</p>
               <p>Some reaſons he attempts to produce, to prove that this world meanes all Adams ſonnes, and thoſe reaſons he draweth from, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. his generall deduction is this, [What world it is that he reconciled, let the Text ſhew,] ſo I ſay alſo, he urgeth thus. [The world of mankinde, verſe 11. we perſwade men;] it is true he perſwaded men, not God, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. and the world of mankinde, men living in the world; and thus we grant that God was in Chriſt reconciling men. But our Author would have (men) in verſe 11. to denote every individuall man, but this without ground; for this phraſe, [He perſwades men] is of like ſenſe with <hi>Luke.</hi> 5.10. [thou ſhalt catch men.] and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. [he that propheſieth ſpeaketh unto men] but theſe take not in every ſonne of Adam, nor can be ſo meant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He thus urgeth, [And theſe men that muſt appeare before the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt.] Verſe 10. true, and ſuch we grant God in Chriſt reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but not all that muſt ſo appeare; for though all ſhall appeare, yet he ſpeaketh not of all that ſhall appeare: it is we that have the earneſt of the ſpirit, verſe 5. wee that walke by faith not ſight, verſe 7. we that love to dwell with the Lord, verſe 8. we that covet to be acceptable to the Lord, verſe 9. it is the ſame we that he ſaith muſt appeare before Chriſts judgement; and the ſame wee, we grant, are reconciled in Chriſt. But none of all theſe former take in all the ſonnes of Adam; therefore are not well produced to prove the word World, verſe 19. to take in every individuall ſon of Adam.</p>
               <p>[3. <hi>He urgeth,</hi> And thoſe men that were dead, verſe 14.] True, let him well underſtand the Text, and I grant it; all that were dead to ſinne, as I have ſhowen in the ſecond Chapter, and then I grant that Chriſt reconciled the All in the world that died to ſinne and themſelves: but this taketh not in every ſonne of Adam. And ſo for the reſt that he ſaith in this point, from what I ſaid in Chap. 2. may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not to availe any thing to prove the word world in verſe 19. to take in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall ſon of Adam: So that this Text helpeth him not.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Text is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1.9. He is the true light that enlightneth every man that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world.] And his deduction here from Is this, [through the ranſome given there is ſome light afforded to every man.] <hi>Lombard</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Text, giveth this ſenſe, <hi>[Non quod nullus ſit qui non illuminetur, ſed quia niſi ab illo nullus illuminatur;]</hi> and this with no little probability.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, the Authour ſhould have ſhowen what enlightning this ſpeaketh of; it may be ſo underſtood as no way to favour him, as not ſpeaking of the ſame thing whereof he affirmeth: it ſeemeth to ſpeake of the light that he put into men in the creation, as may appeare from verſe 5. and 10. immediately after theſe words; we find the world was made by him, he cannot (I beleeve) prove it to be underſtood of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:45603:57"/>
               <p>And herein he proceeds to ſhow, how many wayes the Scripture affirmeth the ſame of the world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the world in generall. <hi>John.</hi> 1.29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.17.] I know what he meaneth by (generall) if he meane as it is <hi>a totum aggregatum,</hi> of which an action may be predicated, yet it agrees but to one part of it; as the world is ſaid to lie in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when it agreeth onely to the unbeleeving part, and ſo he ſhall convince the world of ſin, that is, the unbeleeving part: ſo on the other ſide, he taketh away the ſins of the world, that is, of the unbeleeving part thereof, this I grant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the world diſtributed into its parts, ſome beleeving, ſome not. <hi>John.</hi> 3.16.18.] But will the Author ſay that he came to ſave both parts of the world? the Text ſaith no ſuch thing, but that thoſe that beleeve might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. God is ſaid to love the world, it is true; but diſtribute this world into its parts, and what love doth the Text ſet forth to both its parts? his love to the world, as <hi>(to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum quid)</hi> is there intimated, and ſhowne in his love to the beleeving part thereof, and to the beleeving part in that they ſhall be ſaved: but wherein is the love of God expreſt to the unbeleeving part, let the Text, or the Author from the Text ſpeake. So that though he be here ſaid to love the world, and that is diſtributed into parts, yet no love is expreſſed to both parts of that diſtribution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of the world oppoſed to Beleevers, in the world. 1 <hi>John,</hi> 2.1.] It is cleare to every eye that there is no oppoſition at all in that Text, onely a diverſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. (2.) Neither can he prove that there is a diſtinction of beleevers from unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, but onely of ſome beleevers, to whom he wrote from beleevers all over the world. (3.) For ſuch an aſſertion as this, that Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome for a world oppoſed to beleevers, it is ſuch as cannot be found in any beſide our Author: the Remonſtrants that have made the number as large as may either by ſhew of reaſon or Scripture; yet they profeſſe that <hi>[In horum numero cenſeri non debent impaenitentes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act. Synod.</hi> 285. 286.</note> 
                  <hi>incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duli, rebelles, &amp;c. qua tales,]</hi> that is, in this number of All, the unbeleeving and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, are not to be reckoned; and thus, <hi>[Infidelibus &amp; rebellibus quâ talibus gratia impetrata non eſt:]</hi> that is, grace was not impetrated or procured for the unbeleevers, as ſo. But if our Authors words be true, that he died for the world oppoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; then he dyed for unbeleevers as ſo conſidered; but this no Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of the world divided and ſuch particulars ſet out as cannot be the Elect of God. <hi>John.</hi> 12.47.48.] We had before in the ſecond accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the world diſtributed into its parts, and now we have it divided into its parts; here is judicious diſtinction betwixt diſtributed and divided. (2.) That Text doth not ſay that he came to ſave that part of the world, which he ſaith cannot be meant of the Elect of God. (3.) It is not evident that that place ſpeaketh of ſuch as are not the Elect: many may not receive the word of Chriſt for the preſent, yet be one of Gods choſen, and thus much the Author confeſſeth page 69. thus, [Yea even among theſe are many of Gods Elect and choſen, to whom theſe ſayings agree,] and one of theſe ſayings is this, [neither receiveth nor perceiveth the things of the Spirit.] Yet now this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (he that heareth my words and beleeveth not) muſt needs ſet out ſuch as cannot be Gods elect and choſen ones.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of the world, as the Elect are in due time called out of the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of it and diſtinguiſht from it, whileſt many of the Elect are in it.]
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45603:58"/> He produceth many Texts wherein the word (world) is thus taken; but he produceth not one place wherein it is ſaid that Chriſt came to ſave that world, and therefore he herein requireth no anſwer; yet I ſay of that world he may be ſaid to be the Saviour, yet in reſpect of them that ſhall be called out in time; but that he is the Saviour of that world, out of which all his Elect are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ken, no Scripture ſpeaketh; and therefore that fond flouriſh which he maketh in thoſe after words, the Reader may ſee he hath little ground whereas he ſaith [Of the World every way taken he is the Saviour,] he cannot, nor hath he proved that he is the Saviour of both parts, beleeving and unbeleeving, nor the world oppoſed to beleevers, nor ſuch as cannot be called the elect of God, nor that world out of which all the elect are choſen.</p>
               <p>But after this ſpacious digreſſion upon the word (World) he comes to affirme that [the Elect is never called the World:] ſomething like that of the Remonſtrants, <hi>[vox mundus in Scripturis nunquam electos ſignificat]</hi> that is,<note place="margin">act. Synod. <hi>301.</hi>
                  </note> the word World doth never ſignifie the Elect, which I ſhall not at this time diſprove, but content my ſelfe with this, that there is no need to prove it; ſufficient it is now to prove that the word All doth not take in every ſonne of Adam, and that that thing is ſaid to be done to, and by, and in the World, that is done but to and by and in the beleeving part of the world: and this is not hard, <hi>Col.</hi> 1 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12.13. with others, in which places I thinke alſo the word World denoteth onely the Elect of God, if beleevers be ſuch. But ſtill in proſecution of this, he hath ſeverall Queries, as</p>
               <p>[If we looke at ſuch as ſtumble at Chriſt, doth not the Scripture ſay, ſuch periſh for whom Chriſt died?] To which I anſwer no; no Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth any ſuch thing, not that Text, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.11. It is not affirmative but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory.</p>
               <p>And bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, denying the Lord that bought them. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. I have ſaid ſomething upon this text before, but becauſe it againe offereth it ſelfe, I ſhall adde a few words more; true it is they are ſaid to deny the Lord that bought them; that is, as it is generally received <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to their owne and others judgement; as <hi>Ahaz</hi> is ſaid to ſacrifice to the Gods of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> that ſmote him 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.23. And how can the Author prove that Chriſt did ranſome or buy them any more them the Gods of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> did ſmite <hi>Ahaz:</hi> the one ſaith they denied the Lord that bought them, and the other ſacrificed to the gods that ſmote him; but I know the Author will not ſay that the Gods of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> did really and indeed hurt or ſmite <hi>Ahaz,</hi> but he thought ſo. This I overthrow not, but to it I adde thus much, it was not only as they thought, but <hi>[Secundum vanam jactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,]</hi> as they boaſted, they ſpake proud ſwelling word, ſpake much of Chriſt and his ranſome; now it is frequent in Scripture to upbraid the ſonnes of men with ſuch things as they boaſt of, as if they were ſo indeed, as <hi>Ezek</hi> 28.12. and ſo making their boaſting an aggravation of their ſinne, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.17.23. thou that glorieſt in God, and in the Law, doſt thou by breaking of the Law diſhonour God? So it was not an ordinary ſinne that theſe falſe Prophets are branding, not barely denying him that bought them, for ſo every unbeleever doth in his judgement, but this is more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unbeleever is charged withall; ſeeing he that names Chriſt is tyed thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. And they boaſting of Chriſt they were more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged then others not to deny him, but they did deny the Lord that bought them, that is not that the Text lookes at the reality of the thing, but their boaſting that it was ſo, which made it be an aggravated ſin in thoſe falſe Prophets; and how this agreeth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45603:58"/> with the perſons ſpoke of and other Scriptures, let the Author perpend, and if ſo taken, how much it ſerveth his turne let him alſo judge.</p>
               <p>Are they not ſaid to have troden under foote the Sonne of God?] Thus the Remonſtrant urges, <hi>[Apoſtatae dic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> teſtamenti ad aliquod gratiae faedus cum illis conſtituendum effuſus, &amp;c.]</hi> That is they tread under foote the Sonne of God, therefore he is in ſome way given to them, and his blood ſhed to make ſome covenant of Grace with them; the ſtrength of which inferences I am not able to ſee; for they being gathered to the Church, and ſo hearing Chriſt preached, ſo outwardly profeſſing him, they afterward falling off and not applying themſelves to beleeve on him for ſalvation, tread under foote the Sonne of God; and this they may doe though Chriſt did never purchaſe life and ſalvation for them; as a man may kicke the image of his Soveraigne in his coine, though it was never intended for him.</p>
               <p>Are they not ſaid to be trees twice dead, <hi>Jude,</hi> 12.] Yes we read ſo, but whether the argument framed therefrom be valid, I queſtion; for thus he reaſoneth, they are twice dead, once in Adam, now a ſecond time by their ſinnes: now this ſecond death ſuppoſeth a life intervening which they have from Chriſt; but this is extorted, and not the ſenſe of this nor any other Scriptures. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. For this ſuppoſeth all Adams ſonnes to be made alive, and to be alive, with a life that is beſide what of nature: for this ſpirituall death in ſin, is oppoſed to a ſpirituall life; but this is not the language of Scripture, not one place that I know that ſaith all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams ſons are alive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is frequent with Scripture to ſpeake of things that doe appeare onely as if they were, as Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.9. Without the Law I was alive, that is I thought ſo, but when the Law came I died: here is a ſecond death, but that is oppoſed to an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent life; ſo why may not this Text meane a death oppoſed to an apparent life of grace, which by their ſeeming holineſſe they ſeemed to live, but when they diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are ſaid to die the ſecond time? and this ſeemes backed by the context, Clouds without water; Trees without fruite, twice dead.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Scripture phraſe ſpeaketh that condemnation in Hell is the ſecond death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. <hi>cum</hi> 6. and this ſpoken of men as if it was actually ſo, when yet it meaneth but thus, that it infallibly ſhall be ſo; as he that beleeveth not is condemned, that is, ſhall be in condemnation: he that beleeveth hath everlaſting life, that is, ſhall have it infallibly. So this twice dead, that is, they are ſuch as ſhall certainely die the ſecond death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is uſuall with Scripture, ſpeaking of that which is throughly done, or done indeed, to expreſſe it by twice done, or done doubly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.18.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of anſwering the moſt uſuall and ſtrongeſt objections againſt this truth.</head>
               <p>ANy that looketh upon this title, and his firſt lines of this Chapter, could promiſe himſelfe no leſſe then theſe three particulars. Firſt, that the Author taketh theſe arguments that are moſt uſuall, and thoſe that are of the greateſt force. Secondly, that he propoundeth ſuch in their proper force and vigour, as they are propounded by his adverſaries. Thirdly, that he giveth to theſe pertinent and ſatisfactory anſwers; but that he in all theſe commeth ſhort, ſhall appeare by the following diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument that he ſeemeth to anſwer, he propoundeth thus.</p>
               <p>[The Scripture in ſuch places as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the ſenſe they import:] Wherein he perſwadeth his readers that this is produced by us as an argument to prove the contrary to his aſſertion; but this is falſe and bewrayeth his ignorance; it is produced as an anſwer to the arguments for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on their parts, thereby putting them to prove that thoſe Texts are taken as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth: ſeeing Scripture is not alway taken as it ſeemeth to import. This reſponſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aſſertion of ours ſo much intrencheth upon his over confident concluding upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scriptures, that he rejecteth it as many wayes obnoxious, and affirmeth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thus. [The Scripture ſpeaketh ſometimes plainely, ſometimes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically, parabolically, yet alwayes truly, and ſo as the words import, for God is a God of truth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 31.5.] The weakneſſe of which expreſſions may appeare to any; for it may be underſtood, that when we ſay ſome Scriptures are not to be underſtood as they ſeeme to import, we meane not that they are not to be underſtood as the Spirit it ſelfe meaneth, or as they are uſed by him to expreſſe his meaning, but not ſo as they ſeeme to us to import; not alwayes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature and ordinary ſignification of the word which the Spirit uſeth. Now let us ſee how he oppugneth this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith the Scripture ſometimes ſpeaketh (plainely) ſometimes metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, parabolically.] Now in that he ſaith it ſpeaketh ſometimes plainely, it granteth that ſometimes it ſpeaketh not plainly; now when the Scripture ſpeaketh plainely, we know, <hi>viz.</hi> when the ſenſe of the words is ſo applied to the words in their native and common ſignification, that he that knowes the one, may know the other. But when doe they ſpeake not plainely, certainely it is when he that knoweth the nature and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all acceptation of the words uſed, and followeth that and ſo miſtaketh the true ſenſe, when the ſenſe is beyond the native and uſuall ſenſe of the word, then the Scripture ſpeaketh not plainely: as to inſtance with the Author in metaphoricall &amp;c. ſpeeches, ſuch are tropicall and changed from their native ſignification, unto a foraigne ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; (as his paedagogicall rudiments may informe him) but when they are ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, they mean not as they ſeeme to import; but thus many Scriptures ſpeake as the Author confeſſeth; now thus to ſay, is no way to confute us, but to confirme us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That expreſſion [He ſpeaketh alwayes truly,] is no argument againſt us, becauſe though he meaneth not as the words ſeeme to import, yet he ſpeaketh truly; the truth
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45603:59"/> of his words are ſo deduced from the conformity of the ſenſe to his owne mind, not to the native uſe of the words.</p>
               <p>He afterwards thus argueth.</p>
               <p>[When the Scripture ſaith that by the grace of God he taſted death for every man, and gave himſelfe a ranſome for all men, &amp;c. That any of us ſhould ſay his words have not the ſenſe they ſeeme to import!] Wherein he ſeemeth to wonder that any ſhould preſume ſo to ſay, but it is groundleſſe; for the ſenſe that <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> putteth upon thoſe Scriptures, is that Chriſt by his death procured eternall life for every ſonne of Adam, and this ſenſe the words ſeeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, elſe he forgeth it without any ground; but that is not indeed the ſenſe, my whole diſcourſe ſhoweth; therefore we may well ſay, they have not the ſenſe they ſeeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Againe be thus urgeth.</p>
               <p>[The myſteriouſneſſe of the Scripture ſtands not in any equivocall hiddenneſſe or doubtfulneſſe of ſpeech, as the Oracles of the Heathen Gods, that might be made true which way ſo ever taken, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they imported; but Scriptures though myſterious are ſo full of unchangeable truth, that when by the Spirit the knowledge thereof is given, it will appeare to be right and plaine, according to the words in which it is expreſſed.] But all this is not againſt us; for, 1. True, they are not equivocall, that is, relating to the minde of the ſpeaker; now God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant to deceive as the Heathen Oracles, yet may the Scripture have a ſenſe beyond what the words import, or ſeem to export, becauſe they are myſterious. 2. He is miſtaken in the Heathen Oracles, they were not made true contrary to what they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, becauſe they were ſo framed as that they might import either way; as, <hi>[Aio te Aeacida Romanos vincere poſſe.]</hi> 3. The truth of the Scripture is unchangeable wee grant, but it will not thence follow that ſome places have not a ſenſe beyond what the words naturally import; and when we know the ſenſe, we ſhall ſay that it is true according to the words in a tropicall or figurative tranſmutation, yet not true as the words naturally import: but it matters not how plaine the ſenſe is when we know it; but how is the ſenſe obvious to us before it be revealed? Whether may we not follow the native ſenſe and import of the words, ſo far as to take up a ſenſe contrary to the meaning of Chriſt? if ſo, all that that he ſaith is but empty; but that we may, is cleare from <hi>Nicodemus, John.</hi> 3.4. the diſciples. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.15.16. the Jewes, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.19.20. in which places they judged of his ſpeeches by the naturall import of the words, but in ſo doing cried. But this aſſertion of ours, <hi>viz.</hi> [That the Scripture hath not alway the ſenſe that the words import or ſeeme to import,] is backed with foure ſeverall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as he produceth it, which he attempts to diſprove, but how he performeth I ſhall examine.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1.</head>
                  <p>[Becauſe theſe expreſſions, (the Vine) [this is my body] [I am the doore] are not meant as the words ſeeme to import.] Theſe inſtances he produceth, therefore I ſhall engage with theſe, though more might be produced and others more cleare: thus we urge, if theſe places be not meant as the words ſeem to import, then all Scriptures are not; to this he anſwers thus. This reaſon is unjuſt, injurious, abſurd, falſe, ſo of no ſtrength: and thus he runneth up his black mouth'd catalogue,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45603:60"/> Page 75. which in cloſe will be his owne ſhare; he would prove it injurious thus;</p>
                  <p>[It is confeſſed by all Interpreters as an argument againſt Papiſts, that what ever is neceſſary to ſalvation is therein plainely delivered, as the humble and diligent reader may eaſily underſtand,] but he may know</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That no Interpreter ſaith that every ſcripture is plain and eaſily to be underſtood, neither are we engaged ſo to ſay in any controverſie between us and the Papiſts; they ſay indeed that many are and ſuch as are neceſſary to ſalvation, but this is no way injured by ſaying that ſome Scriptures meane not as the words ſeem to import.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They may ſay that what is neceſſary to ſalvation is plaine; but many places that are urged by the Author, as they relate to the point in controverſie, are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſalvation. Neceſſary it is for us to know Chriſt to die for ſinne, and to be the Meſſiah, and to procure life for them that beleeve; but whether for ſome or for all, it is not neceſſary to ſalvation to know; for I am not ſo uncharitable as to thinke other, but that many holding his doctrine are ſaved, and I hope he is not ſo uncharitable as to hold that they that hold againſt him cannot be ſaved. I beleeve Heaven hath a great harveſt of them that never could aſſent to his doctrine: therefore to ſay that thoſe Scriptures that are not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation to be knowne, are not to be meant as the words import, is not injurious to the ſaying of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that proceeds upon ſuch as are neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They may ſay that ſuch neceſſary truths are plaine to an humble and diligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; true; but we ſay to an unwary and arrogant Reader, that to foment his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits will ſnatch at the naturall import of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He would prove it unjuſt thus.</p>
                  <p>[It is unjuſt, ſeeing it is granted by Interpreters that hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult places, as Sacramentall, allegoricall, parabolicall, are to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by plaine places, not plaine places obſcured by them.] This though true, makes nothing to the proving what we ſay unjuſt. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which we affirme is (that all places are not meant as the words import;) now in that he mentioneth hard, difficult places, as Sacramentall, parabolicall, allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, he confirmeth us; for in ſuch expreſſes, the ſenſe is not as the words ſeeme to import.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It proveth not the aſſertion unjuſt, becauſe we doe not obtrude any ſenſe upon 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. from ſuch hard places; onely ſhow that as in thoſe places the ſenſe is not as the words import, ſo it may be in theſe, leaving the ſenſe to enquiry: and where is the injuſtice in this?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ſaith in the beginning that it is unjuſt to ſay that theſe words [I am a doore, a vine] doe not mean as the words import; yet now he ſaith theſe being pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He prooveth it abſurd and groſſe thus.</p>
                  <p>[It is groſſe, intimating as if the ſenſe of the words ſeeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that Chriſt was a doore of wood; or as if the bread was tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiate into the naturall body of Chriſt, whereas there is no words
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45603:60"/> importing ſuch a ſenſe.] But it is not halfe ſo groſſe as the Authors underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that knoweth not how to diſtinguiſh betwixt the words and ſenſe of the words; we ſay the words mean not as they ſeem to import. And he ſaith it is groſſe, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the ſenſe of the words import Chriſt a materiall doore: groſſe indeed, but this is not the ſenſe of our aſſertion. But this we may ſay, that the words may ſeeme to import ſome ſuch thing, though it be but a groſſe conceit; true it is that any that is acquainted with Scripture language may be able to explode ſuch a ſenſe; but thoſe that are not ſo well acquainted with it may as well by the import of the words thinke Chriſt to be a materiall doore, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of a naturall birth, his Diſciples of a materiall leaven of bread, when he ſpake of the leaven of hereſie and hypocriſie; and the Jewes of the materiall Temple, when he ſpake of the Temple of his Body; yet in in all theſe (how groſſe ſoever) they followed the naturall import of the words. But he illuſtrateth himſelf in this manner.</p>
                  <p>[If a man ſay to his ſervant, reach me my cloth in the preſſe, and a Dame to her maide, turne the cheeſe in the preſſe; the child cries to his mother, the pot runneth over: cannot theſe be underſtood in the ſenſe that the words import?] Certainely, <hi>Animus fuit in patinis,</hi> his minde was in his diſhes, or in the potridge pot; but if his underſtanding had not runne over with the pot, he might have ſeen a wide difference between a Metonymy, and a Metaphor: the inſtances that he produceth are no way oppoſite to the caſe in hand; for if they had, they ſhould have run thus. <hi>If a man ſhould lay to his ſervant I am a preſſe,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He proveth it falſe thus.</p>
                  <p>[It is falſe, for Chriſt is the doore and way of entrance into peace with God, and he is the true Vine indeed, <hi>John.</hi> 15.1.] Be it ſo, yet as he intendeth his owne meaning, the naturall import of the words doth not afford it; we ſay not that he is not the doore of entrance into God and peace, but that by the naturall import of the words themſelves ſuch a meaning cannot be deduced: beſides Chriſt is no more a doore, or a Vine, then he is ſaid to be the ſeeds man, the field the World, the good ſeed the Children of the Kingdome, the Tares the children of the wicked one, the harveſt the end of the World, the reapers the Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.37.38, 39, but theſe have not a reall identity, but a ſimilitude, as verſe 24. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven is like to a man that ſowed, ſo in the reſt, ſo in this, it meaneth but thus; Chriſt is like a doore, and like a Vine, beareth an analogy with them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Text ſaith, he ſpake to them this parable, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.6. relating to the ſame buſineſſe: yet if any ſhall thinke him a materiall doore, they ſhall be deceived, though he ſay I am the doore.

                  <p>[He ſaith not this bread is my body, nor any word to colour ſuch a groſſe conceit as tranſubſtantiation.] Whereas he ſaith [it ſaith not [this bread is my body,] he muſt meane as if Chriſt ſhould ſay this [meaning his owne body, he being there preſent,] is my body; but this is weake and abſurd, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon thoſe reaſons deduced from the Sacramentall uſe and relation, betwixt his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and that which he ſpake of; but it could not be Sacramentall if he meant his body; for it could not be both the ſigne and thing ſignified.

[The ſeven leane Kine are ſeven yeares] &amp;c. But this argument I chiefely propound; when he took the cup, and ſaid [this is my blood] what did he ſhew them? ſome drops of his blood? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely he meant not his blood, but the wine that he took; let him decide himſelfe, <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.20. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The ſecond reaſon by which we prove that all Scripture is not underſtood as the words ſeeme to import, is this; becauſe the phraſes (All men) (every man) &amp;c. ſeems to import no leſſe then every ſonne of Adam; elſe the Author would not ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſten that large ſenſe upon them; but in many Texts ſuch phraſes meane but ſome of Adams ſonnes; therefore not to be underſtood as the words ſeeme to import; to this he anſwers.</p>
                  <p>[This reaſon is already anſwered, and proved vaine and fraudulent in <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.] In this reaſon there are two things, the Antecedent and Conſequent; the Antecedent is of two branches. Firſt, that (All men) (every man) ſeeme to import no leſſe then every ſonne of Adam. Secondly, that in many places it is not ſo largely to be underſtood: the conſequence is this, therefore every Scripture is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as the words ſeeme to import. Now let any peroſe his fifth Chapter, and ſee which of all theſe he hath proved vaine and fraudulent. In my ſixth Chapter I have remooved the ſuppoſed vanity and fraud of this reaſon, by proving theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That where the ſpeech is of God, and by God, thoſe phraſes take not in all Adams ſonnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That thoſe phraſes are not to have the ſame latitude in Redemption as in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the buſineſſe treated of in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. doth not evince thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to have that large extent, to which Chapter I referre the Reader; therefore this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is alſo valid.</p>

                  <p>The third reaſon by which we prove that Scripture is not alwayes meant as the words import, as he produceth it, is this <hi>[Becauſe the death of Christ is oft ſaid to be but for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and thoſe many his Sheepe.]</hi> Now before I reply to his anſwers, I muſt premiſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors unjuſt forgeries in theſe 2 particulars.</p>

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:45603:61"/>1. This is not brought by any (that I know) as a third reaſon, but may be as an illuſtration of the ſecond: thus (All men) (every man) in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. &amp;c. doe not take in every ſonne of Adam; becauſe the death of Chriſt is in Scripture ſaid to be for many, for his ſheepe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. None ſaith that the Scripture ſaith (but for many) but we ſay that it is ſo to be underſtood: therefore All men, cannot be proved neceſſarily to take in all Adams ſons. to this he anſwers.</p>
                  <p>[This reaſon is weake, for the word many ſignifieth all and every, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.19.] Be it ſo, yet let us ſee where the weakeneſſe lies moſt; we argue thus. The death of Chriſt is ſaid in Scripture to be for many, and that many his ſheepe, therefore meant but for many; Therefore when it is ſaid to be for all men, it is not cleare that that phraſe taketh in all Adams ſonnes. He thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The word <hi>many</hi> ſometimes takes in all and every, therefore there where it is ſpoken of the death of Chriſt, it muſt take in every ſonne of Adam; or thus, many, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. is not meant but of ſome; therefore many, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 28. is not ſo meant; let any judge which is moſt weake; one particular cannot conclude negatively againſt an other particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay ſuppoſe (many) in ſome places take in every ſonne of Adam, yet in moſt places, ten to one, it excludeth the largeſt ſenſe, then we may juſtly doubt whether that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. be ſo large in extent.</p>
                  <p>[This is equivocall, ſubtil and fraudulent, ſeeing when (All men) (every man) is affirmed of the death of Chriſt, and the ranſome and fruits thereof only is affirmed for them.]</p>
                  <p>This reply is more full of weakeneſſe then ſubtilty; for let this be granted, yet this is not refelled thereby; that it is not cleare beyond all doubt that (All men) (every man) take in every ſon of Adam. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The words (All men) every man) are uſed when yet there is higher matter ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of then death or ranſome as he taketh ranſome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When he ſpeakes of death or ranſome, it is ſometimes expreſſed generally but in more reſtrictive termes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When in that caſe ſuch generall words are uſed, they are not yet proved to have ſuch a generall ſenſe as to take in every ſon of Adam. All theſe I have proved at large before, therefore little there is in his anſwer.</p>
                  <p>[This reaſon is falſe and ungodly, for it is no where in Scripture ſaid that Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome but for many, or onely for many, or onely for his ſheepe, and it is ungodlineſſe to adde to or are from the word of God.]</p>
                  <p>Be it ſo, what is it againſt us? we ſay not it is the words of Scripture, but that it doth not yet appeare to us but that it is the true ſenſe, becauſe that the word (Many) in moſt places of Scripture excludes that generall ſenſe, and meaneth (but many) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till better proofes to the contrary, we may conclude th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Neither do we ſay that it is the words of Scripture, that he laid downe his life for his ſheepe onely: (therefore thus to charge is both falſe and ungodly) but we ſay it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45603:62"/> is ſo meant, as may appeare by the current of promiſes and the whole ſeries of <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. and we need not feare to affirme this, more then <hi>John.</hi> 3.16. to be meant of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers onely, when he ſaith <hi>[That thoſe that beeleeve might not periſh,]</hi> but of this I have ſpoken at large formerly.</p>
                  <p>[This reaſon is deceitfull and erroneous, for the Scripture doth not ſay thoſe many he died for are his ſheepe.] Wherein we may ſee the Author hath an excellent faculty in multiplication of particulars without neceſſity; he had be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore at his ſecond charge objected againſt it that it was (fraudulent;) now as his fourth, he chargeth it with (deceitfulneſſe,) and as his third he charged it with (falſe,) no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>[As for that Text <hi>John.</hi> 10.15. it is much abuſed, for our Saviour doth not ſet forth the difference between ſuch as he died for, and died not for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But thoſe that beleeve on him, and thoſe that beleeve not on him. verſe. 4, 5.14.26.27.] Whereby it appeareth that he hath not yet diſcovered the chiefe drift of that Chapter, which is to ſhow the difference betwixt himſelfe the good Sheepheard, and thoſe hirelings which he ſo ſharpely charges, verſe 12. So that neither of thoſe differences are principally intended. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Both thoſe differences are ſecondarily intended and proſecuted; for be it ſo that he puts the difference between them that beleeve and them that beleeve not, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are they? let us peruſe the Text: one is, they that beleeve are ſheepe, thoſe that perſiſt in infidelity are not ſo, ver. 26. this is now in relation to God, all are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers or unbeleevers; ſo all are ſheepe or goates, but there are other differences, ſomething what they doe for Chriſt, ſomething what Chriſt doth for them; as [his Sheepe know him,] others doe not: his ſheepe [heare his voice] others doe not. ver. 14. Herein is a double difference cleare, betwixt them that are ſheepe and are not, and them that know him and heare him and them that doe not. So in the things he doth for them, [I know my ſheepe, ver. 14.] others not, [<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.12.] now will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſay that here is not a double difference? <hi>viz.</hi> betwixt them that are ſheepe, and them that are not; the one be knoweth, the other not; as alſo between them that are knowne of him, and them that are not; the one as ſheepe, the other not. So in the other, [I lay downe my life for my ſheepe,] now is not here a cleare difference two
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45603:62"/> wayes, betwixt ſheepe and not ſheepe? the one he died for, the other not, and another involved in it, betwixt them he died for, and thoſe for whom he died not; the one are his ſheepe, the other are not: So in ver. 27, 28. he ſaith, [My ſheepe heare me, and I give them eternall life;] here is a manifeſt difference between ſheepe and not ſheepe, the one have eternall life, the other not: as alſo between them that have eternall life, and them that have not; the one are ſheepe the other are not; ſuch as theſe, and all theſe have in them <hi>[differentiam convertibilem]</hi> convertible differences that may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either wayes; therefore the abuſe of the place lighteth upon himſelfe; for in ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference betwixt them that beleeve, and beleeve not; that are ſheepe, and thoſe that are not: he likewiſe ſhoweth the difference betwixt them that Chriſt died for, and them for whom he did not.</p>
                  <p>[Neither doth he ſhow the priviledge of all he died for, but of thoſe that beleeve on him through the Miniſtration of the Goſpell.] Theſe are ſtill oppoſed very ill; for in ſhowing the priviledges of them that beleeve, he ſhoweth alſo of them for whom he died; for he layeth downe his life for his ſheepe. But if we ſoberly conſider the Text, it will appeare that he layeth downe the priviledge of them for whom he died. For ver. 27. he ſaith, [my ſheepe heare my voice,] doth he not there ſhow the mutuall priviledges of them that are ſheepe, and alſo of them that heare his voice? thoſe that are his ſheepe heare his voice, and ſuch as heare his voice are his ſheepe. ver. 14. [I know my ſheepe,] doth he not there ſhow that all that are knowne of him are ſheepe? ver. 28. [I give my ſheepe eternall life.] doth he not there ſhow, that all to whom he giveth eternall life are ſheepe? if any heare his voice, or know him, or he know any, or give life to any but ſheepe, then are his expreſſes invalid. So in ver. 15. [I lay down my life for my ſheepe;] let him tell me (and not abuſe both reaſon and Scripture) doth not he here ſhow likewiſe that all that he died for are ſheepe? if ſo, then he ſhoweth the priviledge of all he died for, they are ſheep, therefore hear him, he knoweth them, and giveth to them all eternall life; and what is more cleare then this?</p>
                  <p>[Nor was our Saviour ſo much treating of his ranſome giving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as of his Miniſtration of the Goſpel, and ſo his love and faithfulneſſe in it, in laying downe his life for the miniſtred to; and therein gave us an example not to make propitiation for ſinne, but to teſtifie love in ſuffering.] What paines taketh he to abuſe himſelfe, his readers, and the Text at once?

                  <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſaith, [not ſo much of his ranſome as miniſtration of the Goſpell,] ſeemes to intimate that his giving a ranſome or dying, is no part of his miniſtration; that there is a wide difference between them; but he herein abuſes his readers; for his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his life is the greateſt part of his miniſtration. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20 28.

                  <p>The fourth reaſon which he reciteth, (although his martialling them up in order, firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth, proceed from his owne groſſe conceit,) yet it is well put in by way of anſwer to an objection which might ariſe from the premiſes; for if any ſhall aske why Chriſt meaning but ſome, ſhould uſe ſuch words and expreſſions, as by their naturall import may ſeeme to take in every ſonne of Adam, the reaſon is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand, [That ſo the Gentiles might not exclude themſelves, nor the Jewes exclude the Gentiles, when either might on good ground; Chriſt being ſent to the Iewes, not to the way of the Gentiles, and he commands his diſciples accordingly.] This reaſon he undertaketh to refell: and firſt he would ſhow the abſurdity of the aſſertion it ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> [There was great reaſon why, when he meant but ſome, he ſhould yet uſe ſuch expreſſes as may in their naturall import ſeeme to take in all,] and taketh much paines therein as followeth. [That any other doctrine or contrary words ſhould be neceſſary to deliver the Goſpel within theſe our times is monſtrous to affirme.] The reaſon of which, cometh to this iſſue; it is monſtrous to deliver the Goſpel now in our times in contrary words: Therefore it was monſtrous for Chriſt to deliver the Goſpel, or his Apoſtles to deliver the Goſpel, in ſuch expreſſions as might ſeeme to import every man, when yet they meant but ſome; where lyeth the ſtrength of this Argument? Chriſt in himſelfe and his Spirit inſpiring the Apoſtles were <hi>Legiſlatores,</hi> might uſe what expreſſions they pleaſed, we are tied to thoſe which they uſed; beſides we ſay not they were contrary expreſſions; for though he uſed ſuch expreſſions as might import a further meaning, yet they were not contrary to truth nor his owne meaning; for as he ſaith, page 73. [to any that underſtandeth, the truth of of his word wil appeare to be right and plaine according to the words which he uſeth.] But he further urgeth.</p>
                  <p>[Thoſe whoſe faith we are to follow, are ſuch whoſe words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hold forth Chriſt, yeſterday, today, and the ſame for ever.] Which is ſo far from overthrowing us, that it confirmes us; he was for ever the Redeemer and Saviour both of Jewes and Gentiles, which Gentiles ſhould know it and be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him in his time; therefore in his time he uſed ſuch generall expreſſions that might beſpeake ſo much both to the Jew and Gentile; theſe generall terms now uſed mak no change in Chriſt, but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>[Do not the words of Chriſt and his Apoſtles expreſſe their meaning?]
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45603:63"/> This fond Query hath had its anſwer already; yes they doe ſo, but their meaning is not alwayes according to the naturall import of the words.</p>
                  <p>[Did their words ſerve but for their times?] Yes, for ours and after times, and ſo much the reaſon intimateth; for in that it was to make way for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to come in, it is to ſerve till the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in; but this I ſay that the occaſion of thoſe expreſſions had its riſe in thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>[Have any of us found fitter words to expreſſe the Goſpel in theſe times?] No, that were high preſumption; we are tied to the expreſſions which are uſed by the Spirit of God, we are not to dictate to him what if fit for him to uſe; but was Chriſt and his Spirit ſo bound? his reaſon herein is this, becauſe we cannot finde better words then he hath uſed; therefore it was not fit for him to uſe ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall expreſſions, when yet he meant but ſome: what piercing eye can diſcerne the ſtrength of his reaſon? It is irkſome to follow him in ſuch froth and impertinency that can neither pleaſe nor ſatisfie the learned. But he comes at laſt to an extaſy.</p>
                  <p>O ye Heavens be aſtoniſhed!] O the admiration of ignorance! at which the Heavens may ſtand aſtoniſhed, in that he triumphs in ſuch weake reaſonings, and at his impudence in putting ſuch into print to ſcourge the eares of the world. Wee conclude Chriſt was free to uſe what words he pleaſed: we not ſo; his expreſſes were true, though not conformable to our underſtandings; and though he uſed, ſuch as [All men] [Every man] [whole world] yet they were no way contrary to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, though he meant but ſome, or but many, or his ſheepe; they may <hi>(bene conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire interſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He then invadeth the reaſon it ſelfe, why Chriſt ſhould uſe ſuch generall expreſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> to temper thoſe particular ones which he had uſed before, with which thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall might agree, yet cure ſome miſtakes that might and did ariſe from the particular; the reaſon he ſets downe and then anſwers, this reaſon is grounded on the enſuing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which he reciteth.</p>
                  <p>The ground of it in full vigour is thus; the legall pedagogy that was the finger to point at Chriſt to type him out, was exhibited onely to the Jewes, as priviledges rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Chriſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5. When he was foretold by the Angel, he was ſaid to be the Saviour of his people, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21.

He forbad his Diſciples to go into the way of the Gentiles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. Hence we conclude that ſeeing he came to redunate both Jew and Gentile, that he ſhould uſe ſome other expreſſions that might temper thoſe particular and confining words to the Jewes onely. To this he thus replyeth.</p>
                  <p>[This part of the reaſon is weake and frothy, for it is evident to a meane underſtanding, that our Saviour <hi>Matthew.</hi> 15.24. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of his miſſion to die, &amp;c. but his miſſion for his miniſtration here on earth, which was for the Jewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. which miſſion with greater enlargedneſſe he left with his Diſciples, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.20.] I ſhall firſt cleare further the force of the reaſon, then rejoyne to his reply; the firſt I ſhall doe in ſhowing theſe 3 particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there were many things at which the Jewes might take occaſion to ſtumble at the Gentiles; as Chriſt being borne of the Jewes, the ſeed of Abraham, brought
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45603:64"/> up amongſt them, exerciſing his miniſtry, living, dying amongſt them, chargeing his Apoſtles not to go to the Gentiles as ſtrangers and dogge; which are cleare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 3, 4, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That from thoſe there was an actuall ſtumbling at them, as a people eſtranged and uncleane; hence in their Law it was forbidden to accompany with a Gentile, <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.3 and when they ſaw that the Gentiles beleeved they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.45. even beleeving Jewes, <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.18. they ſaid [then hath God gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted repentance to the Gentiles,] a thing which they knew not before; it was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the received opinion of the Gentiles on the ſame ground before mentioned, yea <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe was not free from this, in that a viſion was ſent to him to prepare him to goe to <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Gentile, and from his owne words, <hi>Acts,</hi> 10.34. [of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecte of perſons, but that in every Nation] it was not his thoughts before, they thought that no ſalvation was promiſed to the Gentiles upon faith and obedience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That God did cure this by a viſion to <hi>Peter, Acts.</hi> 10.11, 12, 13. a ſheet in which were all manner of beaſts; ſo he was to feed without diſcrimination, and this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipollent to thoſe generall expreſſes (all men) (every man,) the one being in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroglyphicke, what the other is in <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> and both theſe to prevent and remove the ſame ſtumbling blocke againſt the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Now to conſider his reply.</p>
                  <p>He faith this reaſon is weake and frothy: But had not his underſtanding been of the meaneſt ſort, he might have ſeen that his miſſion in <hi>Mat</hi> 15 24. doth not exclude his death and ranſome giving, it mentioneth nothing but ſtands as indifferent to receive any thing that he did as part of his miniſtration here on earth, of which his dying was a part and the cheife part, and all things elſe in reference to it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. [To mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and to give his life a ranſome for many,] therefore for him to ſay not to die but to miniſter to, is weake and frothy; and his oppoſing theſe two, (death) and (mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration here on earth,) intimateth that either his death is no part of his miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe that part of his miniſtration was not done on earth; both moſt falſe and abſurd.</p>
                  <p>[And yet the reſtraint of his miſſion to the Iews, is not wholly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; for then the woman could not have been commended for faith, and helped thereby, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.24.28.]</p>
                  <p>It makes not whether it were wholy excluſive, yea or no, it ſufficeth us if there was good ground ſo to thinke, as any may ſee there was, when he anſwered to her ſuite, [I was not ſent but to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael,] now the Jewes being ready to ſnatch at the word, [houſe of Iſrael] as their proper priviledge, which is refelled <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. by the Apoſtle; they might and did hence conclude that he was ſent to none but them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Chriſt went not thither to miniſter the Goſpel by vertue of his miſſion, but onely to hide and ſecure himſelfe in thoſe parts of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon;</hi> therefore this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall act to the <hi>Phaenician</hi> woman doth not argue that his miſſion was not confined to the houſe of Iſrael. To conclude, were his miſſion to die, or onely to promulge the Goſpel, the one, or other, or both; yet his ſpeech <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.24 gave good occaſion to the Jewes to exclude the Gentiles from Chriſt, which he removeth, and reaſon there was he ſhould ſo remove it.</p>
                  <p>[And of the ſame nature was the ſending of his Diſciples, and of no
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45603:64"/> further as yet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5.] This is but new divinity, to ſay that the miſſion of Chriſt and of the Apoſtles was of the ſame nature, when his Father ſent him to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael; he came to ſave that which was loſt, to redeeme, to dye for. <hi>John.</hi> 3.16. But when Chriſt ſent his Diſciples to the loſt ſheepe of Iſrael, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. he ſent them not to dye for them, to be their Saviours; Chriſt was ſent to performe the whole work of miniſtration, they but a part, to be adjutant in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel; and true, Chriſt had done no more yet, but he was ſent to doe more, even to dye.</p>
                  <p>[This could be no reaſon to darken or ſtreighten the extent of the death of Chriſt, much leſſe of uſing ſuch generall termes as all men, &amp;c.] True, neither did he ſtreighten it, but enlarged it, not larger then it was indeed, but larger then the Jewes did apprehend it; and this was reaſon enough of uſing ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall terms as made way for the Gentiles. But he attempteth to prove that thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall termes could not be produced to cure ſuch an offence taken from ſuch ſpeeches. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15 24. Thus,</p>
                  <p>[1. Before the miſſion of Chriſts Diſciples, or his ſpeaking to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he was ſaid to be ſend into the world, that the world might be ſaved, &amp;c.] Which proveth it not, becauſe although thoſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were before his ſpeech to his Diſciples and the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet they were not before ſuch expreſſions as were equipollent, and might adminiſter like and equall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To paſſe by all the Propheſies, types, prefigurations of Chriſt which were exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to the Jews onely; in which regard they have the preheminence of the Gentiles; but <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. he is ſaid by the angels to be the Saviour of his people: and expreſly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.6. Iſrael, this was enough to create that ſtumbling againſt the Gentiles, but this was before any ſuch generall terms.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the word world, doth not temper thoſe confining expreſſions, becauſe that word might and is uſed as to include no more then the Jewes, they being moſt potent and cathol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>[2. Their miſſion was afterwards enlarged to goe into all the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. and then no neceſſity of uſing words importing more then truth.] To wave his expreſſes of [uſing words importing more then truth,] being the reſult of his folly; we may ſay that their miſſion being enlarged to all the world, there was good reaſon to uſe ſuch expreſſions as might admit both Jew and Gentile; elſe they would not be received; for <hi>Peter</hi> for all his commiſſion, he was queſtioned for comming to the Gentiles, <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.1.2.3. and they were not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied till he ſhewes them the viſion, which was but equivalent to theſe generall terms, and then they admitted them, but with admiration, that to them ſhould be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted repentance.</p>

Whileſt theſe generall words were frequent in uſe, the ſame is ſtill affirmed of Chriſts adminiſtration, that it was for the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8, 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] And good reaſon becauſe thoſe generall expreſſes were to let in the Gentiles, not to exclude the Iewes; but therein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8, 9. both Jew and Gentile are inſerted, that they might both mutually embrace each other, this argueth not thoſe generall expreſſes were not uſed to cure a miſtake in the Iewes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Gentiles, when there were no ſuch expreſſions as did let them in: if he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45603:65"/> had produced any Text, ſpeaking of the Iewes ſo excluſively as formerly, then he had ſaid ſomething; but take his reaſons as they are, and they are reaſonleſſe and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and by this it appeares that yet our reaſon hath more in it then he with all his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can reſiſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of this laſt reaſon as he calleth it, is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>[Had not the Jewes been for a long time the onely people of God, and might not other nations think themſelves excluded, being called ſtrangers, and aliens? and was not the receiving of the Gentiles a thing new to the Apoſtles? <hi>Acts.</hi> 10. therefore there was great reaſon ſuch generall words ſhould be uſed, which might enforme the Iewes, and encourage the Gentiles, and them that went to preach to them, as it did to <hi>Peter</hi> to go to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family, which otherwiſe he would have beene as backward to, as to eate the creatures that he called uncleane; and he was moved thereto, when he knew that of every Nation thoſe that worke righteouſneſſe are accepted of God; and this is one reaſon why ſuch expreſſions are ſo frequent in Scripture,] this reaſon he is pleaſed to brand with the titles of weake and frothy, he foames out little but ſuch expreſſions of venome and contempt, but how doth he make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare?</p>
                  <p>Thus, [The ignorance of ſome in the myſteries of grace, is no proofe that the God of Truth will ſpeake beyond the bounds of Truth.] Which is the empty reply that he gave to the firſt part of this reaſon, wherein he urgeth me to ſay againe that Gods uſing ſuch expreſſions, when yet he meanes but ſome, is no way contrary to truth. This I have proved at large, and it is in many pages confeſſed by himſelfe, in that All, and every man, are in many places of Scripture taken but for ſome, as any may ſee in my ſixth Chapter: all this being granted, yet the Author may well know that the ignorance of ſome in the myſteries of grace, may adminiſter occaſion of uſing ſuch expreſſions as may cure that ignorance and miſtakes, which yet may be wreſted, &amp; by their naturall import ſeem to yeeld an other meaning; and where is the emptineſſe in all this? So for the reſt of his reply, it is nothing but a heap of reitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate abſurdities, which for me to trace, will be as unpleaſing in me as in him; when I am informed of any particular that requireth diſtinct and new ſatisfaction, I ſhall ſay more: To ſome few onely I ſhall in few words rejoyne.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, page 83. 84. [The Jewes that beleeved, did not contend for preaching the goſpel to the Gentiles, (as doubting of ranſom for them) but for fellowſhip and partaking of their priviledges, being not regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; therefore that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.45. &amp; 11.18. &amp;c. is miſalledged.] Hence inferring, that theſe expreſſes (All men) (every man) being applied to the death and ranſome of Chriſt, needed not to be produced to cure any ſuch ſtumbling of the Iewes, becauſe there was no ſtumbling concerning the Goſpel or death or ranſome, but onely at their partaking of priviledges: now the argument is good, but weakely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as elſewhere when he produceth that which is pertinent, he falleth ſhort in proofe.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There was as fair occaſion of ſtumbling at the Gentiles receiving of the Goſpel, or any ſpirituall benefit from Chriſts death, as any temporall; the diſcrimination is more made in ſpirituall then temporall priviledges, as appeares <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. go not to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that is, to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. covenants, glory, law, promiſes, Chriſt, were their peculiar priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. the oracles of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they did ſtumble at that is evident; by the cure we may gather the diſeaſe;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45603:65"/> what was the viſion to prepare <hi>Peter</hi> for? <hi>Acts,</hi> 10. to receive them into ſome outward priviledge onely? or whether to go to them to preach the Goſpel? conſult with that Text, any that pleaſe; what was the occaſion that the Iewes contended with <hi>Peter?</hi> was it becauſe the Geniles had partaken of outward priviledges? or becauſe they had received the word of God? conſult with <hi>Acts,</hi> 11.1. what is more cleare then that the Iewes ſtumbled at the preaching Goſpel to them?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſay they ſtumbled not at their receiving of the Goſpel, but partaking of priviledges, is too weak; they are not to be oppoſed; for in partaking of the Goſpel they looked at it as partaking of their chiefe priviledge; for ſo it was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2.3. &amp; 9.3.4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What did the Jewes admire, what were they aſtoniſhed at? not for any outward priviledges, but for the receiving the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts,</hi> 10.45. that repentance to life was granted to them, <hi>Acts,</hi> 11.18. they thought no Goſpel, no life, no repentance, no Chriſt, no Holy Ghoſt belong'd to them; this is cleare to any capacity; therefore it is reaſon that ſuch termes ſhould be uſed as might let in the Gentiles: to all theſe he urgeth further, p. 85.</p>
                  <p>[On whoſe part could it be a reaſon for ſuch an end? not to the beleeving Jewes in reſpect of themſelves, becauſe they reckon'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the people of God.] Which might well have been ſpared, becauſe wee plead it not to confirme the Jewes of themſelves, but to let in the Gentiles of whom they doubted: yet ſomething in reſpect of themſelves, that they might not thinke themſelves ſolely the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or becauſe lineally diſcended, but that they are ſo by the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all that beleeve are ſo, which the Apoſtle labours much to preſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6.7.8. <hi>Gal</hi> 3.7.8.9. which is much helped by ſuch generall expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons letting in the Gentiles. [For the Jewes in reſpect of Gentiles, it could be no reaſon whileſt the miniſtration of the Goſpel was not ſent to the Gentiles.] To this I ſay, neither were ſuch generall expreſſions frequent or much uſed, if at all, till ſuch times as the Apoſtles commiſſion was inlarged, but if any be found, it was to prepare them for that buſineſſe before hand, as the viſion was ſent to <hi>Peter</hi> before he heard of his going to <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Againe,</p>
                  <p>[We ſee it had not that effect with the beleeving Jewes, who were not by ſuch words prevailed with.] Which is palpably falſe; for, <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.18. by that which was equipollent, <hi>viz.</hi> the viſion, they ſtumbled not, but received the Gentiles, now they ſaw that repentance was granted to them.</p>
                  <p>Againe he urgeth, [On the part of ſuch Gentiles as were brought to beleeve, before the uſe of ſuch generall words, it could be no reaſon; and yet to them is the Goſpel ſet forth in generall termes.] None of his produced Texts, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 3.22. &amp; 5.12.18. prove that any Gentile was converted before the uſe of ſuch generall termes; yet the thing I deny not; for be it ſo, and though no reaſon can be produced on their part, yet for others that were to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the enlarged commiſſion to the Apoſtles, they were looked at by themſelves and others to partake of thoſe priviledges, as being indeared to the Iewes being Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, and ſo under the notion of Iewes; but hitherto there was no way for Gentiles as Gentiles, and unproſelyted to the Iewes to partake of any, which was a myſtery hidden till then, revealed in ſuch expreſſions, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20.26, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſhall conclude with his owne words, let our weake and and frothy reaſons,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45603:66"/> his irreffragable and ſtrong anſwers, and the dealing with Scripture in both be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and then we are content that thoſe Epithites, injurious, unjuſt, abſurd, falſe, weake, fraudulent, ungodly, deceitfull, frothy, (termes which he much trades in) reſt where they fall; and let me counſel him ere I goe from this, to be more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to himſelfe, and ſpare thoſe loades of epithites of calumny, (ſymptomes of a bad cauſe, or weake maintainers of a good one) for in the upſhot they prove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly his owne ſhare, and ſo in branding an other, he pictureth out himſelfe to the life.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond Argument which he undertaketh to refute as he produceth, it is this.</p>
               <p>[Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> makes it an infallible marke of the love of Chriſt to them for whom he died and laid down his life, 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.16.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt did not die for every man.] The former which he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, was no argument; and this ſo miſerably abuſed, that any intelligent man may be aſhamed to owne it, and confident I am he cannot produce it from any pen, unleſſe ſuch as himſelfe, propounding it purpoſely to make it vile and odious; that wherin the vigour of the argument lyeth, is left out, and a ſuperfluity of confuſion intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, which giveth us a taſte of his faithfulneſſe in this buſineſſe, which he at firſt promiſed; if he do it willingly, he is to be blamed; if ignorantly, he will not I hope thinke much to be informed: the argument in its genuine ſhape runs thus, and it was the ſixth in order in the conſcience at <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[Thoſe for whom Chriſt died, he loved them (ſome) with the top and greateſt love that is ſhowne to man,</p>
               <p>But ſo he loveth not all and every man with his greateſt love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> He died not for every man,] that is for every ſon of <hi>Adam.</hi>]</p>
               <p>The major propoſition, is grounded on many Texts, wherein the love of Chriſt in dying for us is not ſet downe as an expreſſion of love barely, but with an emphaſis and tranſcendebly, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. a love with all commendation or magnification, 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.16. He ſo loved the world; not great love onely but greateſt, <hi>John</hi> 15.13. no greater love then for a man to lay downe his life for his friend; but Chriſts greater, in that he did it when we were enemies; therefore we propound it not ſo remiſſely as he fallaciouſly, [whom he dieth for he loveth,] and no more, but loveth eminently with the greateſt love.</p>
               <p>The minor is undeniable; for that God ſhould love every man moſt and with his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love, yea the damned with ſo great, as beloveth the ſaved withall, the Arminians durſt never yet affirme, Scripture no where ſpeaketh, and the Author himſelfe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth, page 89. [to ſome more eſpeciall love is ſhowne.] Now any may ſee the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45603:66"/> wide difference betwixt the argument in its genuine force, and as he propoundes it, and all his anſwers fall to the ground, being apted not to the argument, but his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of it, yet I ſhall reply that I may reduce him to truth.</p>
               <p>As for that Text 1 <hi>Iohn,</hi> 3.16. it is picked out of purpoſe by himſelf, it is not ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holding f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereby perceive we that love, Cap. 4.10, 11. and if he ſo loved us, and behold what love. Cap. 3 ver. 1. Now can every ſon of Adam? ſay, I perceive the greateſt love of God to me in that Chriſt died for me; if every man perceiveth the greateſt love, then no roome for his expreſſe, page 89.

               <p>His after-plea [The place ſpeakes of the perception of love by beleivers,] helpeth not, becauſe it ſpeaketh of no other perception then what aroſe from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aſſertion: [Chriſt hath died for us,] it is a concluſion from infallible premiſes which any may conclude that can ſo premiſe; there is ſuch a connexion betwixt his dying for and his greateſt love, that every one that affirmeth the one, doth <hi>(in eodem inſtanti)</hi> affirme the other; it is no ſpeciall priviledge of ſome to perceive his greateſt love in dying for them, but of all for whom he died. Thus for the major.</p>
               <p>He then violently aſſaulteth the minor thus,</p>

[God giveth to ſome more ſpeciall love] if ſo, then he loveth not every man with his ſpeciall and greateſt love; nay, yet further he ſaith, page 90. [If it had been God loveth not every man in the world, it might be granted and proved,] which is more then he can prove; but if it be a truth that he loveth not every man in the world, then certainely it is far from infidelity and blaſphemy, to ſay that he loveth not every man with his tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and greateſt love; no nor ever hath loved every man with his greateſt love. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſuch blaſphemy as he pretendeth, to ſay, that he hath not nor doth love any but his Church with his tranſcendent or greateſt love; the Apoſtle giveth great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to affirme, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26. He therefore exhorteth to conjugall affection, which is the greateſt and ſtrongeſt of all relations, and to the greateſt and higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that kinde; and the patterne of this he fetcheth from Chriſt to his Church, and that expreſſed in giving up himſelfe to death for them; is it not cleare that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his Church with his tranſcendent and greateſt love? nay, this he plainely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, page 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when the Scripture commendeth his love, it is not that he gives them

Thirdly, he ſaith it contradicteth [the force of all his exhortations, and calls to ſuch as refuſe,] nay, it leaveth a way for theſe, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not his higheſt love; for greater it is for God to give hearts willing to obey his call, which his very words intimate he giveth not to all, therefore loveth not all with his higheſt love. And ſo for the reſt, they are weake and to no purpoſe alledged, onely apted againſt this poſition, [that God hath not loved every man at all,] which is not our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; let them that broach it maintaine it.</p>
               <p>But he hath a more ſtupendious piece of blaſphemy againſt our aſſumption, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[It ſaith he hath not loved any other of mankinde, no not when he made and beheld them all righteous, but hated them; Oh fearefull to ſay! that he hateth the righteous, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.7.] But here envy ſpeaketh, and ignorance admires; for we ſay not, nor can it be infer'd from us, that God loved not innocent man at all, but that he loved not him with his tranſcendent and greateſt love, he did not manifeſt the top of his love to him: and this is no ſuch blaſphemy or fearefull thing to ſay; for the gift that he gave to his Church, <hi>viz.</hi> (His Son) was greater then primitive grace, or any thing that he conferred in the creation, and our deſerts leſſe; for though in creation we could deſerve no good, and ſo his gift be free: yet now in in our reſtoring we deſerved much evill; in creation what good he gave us was onely without merit, but he now beſtoweth all againſt our me it; hence the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puts the emphaſis of love upon the worke of redemption, mercy having more in it then meere goodneſſe: by the former rather then by the latter, he would be knowne as by his glory. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. &amp; 34.6.7.</p>
               <p>But beſides why ſhould he faſten that on us as blaſphemy, which will prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his owne words? he ſaith, [to hate is to love in a leſſe degree,] page 92. now doth not God love the righteous in a leſſe degree then he loveth his onely Sonne in? then he hateth the righteous by his owne doctrine; oh fearefull to ſay! but thus much is cleare, that grant him that God loved innocent man; yet it followeth not, that he loved every man with the top and greateſt of his love; ſo that our Minor yet ſtandeth good.</p>
               <p>But he deſcendeth to give ſome ſatisfactory anſwer to the argument, and it is well he doth ſo, for his former words have yeelded but little, it is well if his afterwords
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45603:67"/> yeeld more; we ſhall not ſhut our eyes againſt it. He would have the Scripture ſhewed where it ſpeaketh of the love and hatred; let it be ſo, as alſo his words which are theſe. [The Scripture mentioneth a diverſe kinde and degree of love and hatred in God ſhewen in the effects of it.] Now herein I ſhall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyne iſſue with him, ſeriouſly to conſider and weigh not onely what Scripture ſaith, but what the Scripture meaneth in ſuch ſpeeches, leaſt we vent our owne conceits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the nature of God; love and hatred is no more attributed to God, then deſire, griefe, rejoycing, with all other affections and paſſions of men, which in us are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, and why not then love and hatred? but to grant any perturbations in God, comes little ſhort of blaſphemy; therefore it may be controverted, whether as all the reſt of our affections (incident to us) ſo love and hatred be attributed to God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, or onely by an Anthropopathy; as the members of our body are given to him by an Anthropomorphy; that there is ſuch a thing in God which we call love I grant; but that the name of love and hatred is but figuratively given to it, that alſo I affirme; Gods love is generally thus defined. <hi>[Velle dare bonum creaturis,]</hi> a will to beſtow good upon his creatures; now this will is properly ſaid to be in God, but it is (as I conceive) figuratively called love, after the manner of men, becauſe whom man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, to him he willeth to beſtow good: So Gods will to beſtow good is termed his love; yet this is the difference, mans will to beſtow good is an effect of his love; but God when he willeth to give good, it is not any effect of his love, but his love it ſelf. Scripture furniſheth us with ſuch expreſſions, <hi>John.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he ſent his Sonne,</hi> that is, his actuall ſending is an effect of his love, that is of his will to ſend; but we never finde this nor any ſuch, God ſo loved that he willed to ſend his Sonne, becauſe his will to ſend his Sonne is that love it ſelfe.

               <p>I ſhall not inſiſt on theſe termes, though I might and ſhow his want of wiſdome in hinting ſuch expreſſions without explanation; for true, the Scripture gives to God [compaſſion,] but in compaſſion there muſt needs be paſſion, but none in God: Nor yet to inſiſt upon what he ſaith of either by way of bounding to each its limits in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45603:68"/> good things beſtowed, though I might expatiate my ſelfe herein; for he maketh Gods compaſſion and mercy to extend no further then to make men ſalvable, and his delight to be in the giving union and poſſeſſion of all priviledges, but this diviſion is without ground; for all good that God gives to fallen man, even to glory it ſelfe, floweth from his compaſſion and mercy; glory in heaven is mercy as well as any thing we receive on earth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. and all that love that reſts not till the party loved be brought into union &amp;c. is that love of compaſſion, (though he make it to be the love of delight,) which properly reſts not till all that be done; for delight is rather in the thing done, then tending to the doing of it; theſe two conſtitute not a good diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as he boundeth them: but theſe with many other things I paſſe by, and come to examine what he ſpeaketh of hatred: that alſo he ſaith is twofold.</p>
               <p>[1. A not ſo much loving, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.30.31.33. <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A poſitive and furious hatred tending to the deſtruction of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.11.]</p>
               <p>Now that a not ſo much loving ſhould be called hatred, is not cleare from thoſe Texts alledged; as for <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.30. that Text ſpeaketh not of a leſſe degree of love, but of no love at all, that is, conjugall affection; ſo he loved her not at all, therefore hated her: and for <hi>Luke,</hi> 14.26. there is not ſpoken of a leſſe love, but abſolute ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, if they ſtand in oppoſition to Chriſt; for elſe it is enough to give worldly reſpects ſome part, ſo that we give Chriſt the greateſt part of our love; but this is not ſound divinity. Againe if a not ſo much loving be hating, then it is no ſuch fearefull thing to ſay that God hateth the righteous; for certaine it is that he loveth not them ſo much as he doth his onely Sonne. But to let this paſſe, I am now to examine how he well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth theſe weapons to cut down our aſſumption. That of Gods love he purſueth thus farre.</p>
               <p>[A love of compaſſion and mercy, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 136.25.145.8.9. is ſuch a love as extendeth it ſelfe ſo farre for the good of man loved in good things afforded, that a man is made ſalvable and ſo much done for him that in accepting, &amp;c. he maybe ſaved. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.5.6.7.]</p>
               <p>That God is full of compaſſion, and his mercy is over all his workes, and he ſaveth man and beaſt, thoſe Texts affirme, and that by the virtue of his compaſſion the ſonnes of men come to partake of the well of life we grant; but all the reſt is of his owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: none of theſe Texts ſay that every of the ſonnes of men have ſo much of Gods compaſſion as to have life procured for them by Chriſts death, no nor yet that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man enjoyeth the height of Gods compaſſion, this is to be yet proved; for if creatures irration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll, may have much of Gods compaſſion, and yet not the height of his compaſſion; why may not ſome men have much compaſſion, yet not the height of it: yet our aſſumption ſtands firme.</p>
               <p>Againe he ſaith, [Leſſe love then this was not to the Angels before they fell, nor leſſe love to mankinde before the fall, <hi>Ecel.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.] This though it ſerve him not, yet he diſcovereth his folly; for this ſuppoſeth that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men had compaſſion ſhowen them before they fell; but this is falſe; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion preſuppoſeth miſery and the fall which was not before the fall; but what is the reſult of all this? no more but this, that all men have ſome degree of Gods compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on manifeſted on them; but what is all this to prove that every man hath the height of his compaſſion? ſo that his reaſoning cometh to this head: every man hath ſome
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:45603:68"/> compaſſion ſhowed him, therefore that is high blaſphemy to ſay that every man hath not the height of his compaſſion; this is but miſerable reaſoning.</p>
               <p>Againe thus he urgeth, [The love of compaſſion, and the hatred that is in a leſſe degree of love, may ſtand together both in God and man, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.1.2.] This is a truth, nay I ſhall grant further, that his love of compaſſion and his poſitive hatred may ſtand together, that is, God may give ſome expreſſes of his compaſſion to many whoſe deſtruction he willeth, and whom he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to deſtroy; and this is ſo far from overthrowing, that it confirmeth our aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it cleareth this, that every degree of his compaſſion enjoyed, doth not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue an eye to the ſalvation of them whom God beſtoweth that low degree of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on; therefore the compaſſion that God ſhoweth to many, is no argument that every man enjoyeth alſo the height of Gods compaſſion: Yet hitherto we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched.</p>
               <p>He ſaith further, [To ſay whoever he loveth with the love of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he loveth for ever, or to ſay he hateth (with any other hatred then that which is in the leſſe degree of love,) any before they have hardened their hearts againſt him, &amp;c. is contrary to <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 9.10. to 15. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.11.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1.18.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.4.5.] In which words there is confuſion, impropriety, and fallacy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſpeakes confuſedly, not diſtinguiſhing the ſeverall degrees of his compaſſion; for it may be granted that to whom he giveth ſome degrees of his compaſſion, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not that for ever, becauſe ſome good he may give that is not to laſt for ever, <hi>viz.</hi> a temporall good; yet certainely to whom he giveth his higheſt pitch of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he loveth ſuch for ever: Will he ſay that <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.15. is not an everlaſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion? that compaſſion mentioned, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33.34. is not for ever continued: conſult with 36.37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſpeaketh improperly, becauſe though hatred may ſtand with a leſſe degree of love, that is, he may deny ſome good to them to whom he giveth ſome good; yet it is not proper to ſay that hatred conſiſts in that leſſe degree of love; for in that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth any good he hateth not, neither can hatred conſiſt in the giving that good, but rather in the deniall of a greater good; he hated nor <hi>Eſau</hi> in that he gave him ſome good, but in that he gave him not that great good that he gave to <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſpeaketh fallaciouſly, ſuggeſting to his followers that we hold that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with a hatred, that is without any degree of love; that is, he ſo willeth evill to to them, that he willeth not to beſtow any good at all; but this we ſay not; for the greateſt hatred, is to will to deny grace and glory, but God may give much good to ſuch; he hateth not the reprobate with the hatred that excludeth all good; yet ſome, and many he hateth ſo as to deny them the top and height of his compaſſion, and that before they turne away their hearts from him; and how doth he in all this overthrow the Minor? but by this hatred which he makes to be after their turning away from him. I ſuppoſe he meaneth (or at leaſt ſhould doe) his will to deny ſaving grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and then happily</p>
               <p n="4">4. He may ſeeme to ſpeake falſely; for his will ſo to doe is not after their turning away from him, but long before it; there is a double hatred of God mentioned in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 1. A denyall of ſaving grace to ſome which he giveth others, whence their turning away from him followeth, which others having turne not away. 2: A pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45603:69"/> of ſuch for turning away; now the firſt is proper to our controverſie, and it is no way againſt Scripture to ſay that ſuch hatred is before men turne away from God; of the latter his Texts ſpeakes, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.15. and nothing to the purpoſe; for more then this cannot be concluded; that God deſtroyeth none till they turne away from him, which any may grant: our hardning or not hardning our hearts cannot be the meaſure of his giving or denying grace, or will ſo to doe, becauſe his giving or not giving ſaving grace, is before our hardning or not hardning our hearts; as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doth not deny grace and glory to all that turne from him: all turning from him are not ſo hated of him. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo in a greater meaſure then many that God never willed to give grace or glory to, and in them who are given over, and denied his ſpeciall grace and ſo hated of him; he doing of it in time willed to do ſo before time, as be confeſſeth p. 121. If ſo, he hated them before they hardned themſelves againſt him; <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated before he had done good or evill; now if he be hated (as they would have it) in a ſmall degree, without and before his evill, why may not God hate him in the higheſt degree before his evill? Juſtice is ſeene in ſmall things as well as great ones; if any ſhall ſay, his foreſight of their ſinnes is the cauſe why he ſo hateth them: I demand why did not the foreſight of <hi>Pauls</hi> infidelity move him to hate him which he ſaw to be greater then of many who were hated, and paſſed by both in reſpect of grace and glory? but he concludeth, wherein if ever, he muſt undoe our aſſumption.</p>
               <p>[For ſuch as while his compaſſion floweth, &amp;c. they will perſiſt till he give them up to Satan, ſuch are reprobated of God, and ſo hated of him,<note place="margin">Ezeck. 24.13. Ier. 6.16.27.30. 1 Ioh. 5.18</note> &amp;c. and none but ſuch ſet forth in Scripture to be hated of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23.33. which overthroweth the aſſumption.] Which words are yet very fallacious, therefore not fit to ſatisfie us withall; for, we grant ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt till they be given up are hated, and that in the higheſt degree; but here is the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do they then begin to be hated of him? doth Gods hatred follow or precede their being given up, yea their perſiſting? Gods hatred or reprobation we make no more then a will in God to deny both ſpeciall grace and glory. Now did he not will to deny it, nay did he not deny it actually to them before they perſiſted? certainely he did, elſe they would not ſo perſiſt.</p>
               <p>We never finde this method, or God thus ſaying [If thou perſiſt I will reprobate thee.] Or, [if thou perſiſt till I give thee over to Satan, I will deny thee my ſpeciall grace and decree ſo to do,] let the Author produce ſuch if he can. But wherein hath he in all this overthrowne the aſſumption? his aſſertions are overthrowne, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have not ſtrength to overthrow this aſſumption, that is ſetled upon ſuch evidence; cleare it is, (all that he ſaith notwithſtanding) that God did decree to deny the height of his compaſſion to many, long before they perſiſted in rebellion; if ſo, then he did not intend Chriſt to them, which is the height of his compaſſion.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Texts cited by him do all ſpeake thus much, that every man is not loved with the height of his compaſſion, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. ſpeaketh thus much, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was not ſo much loved as <hi>Iacob;</hi> and therein affirmeth that he was not loved with the height of his love; for if he had been ſo loved, he had received ſo much grace as to have kept his birthright. And this the Author granteth, page 93. [That <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated in reſpect of peculiar love.] But he ſaith, [The hatred of <hi>Eſau</hi> may ſtand with the love of compaſſion.] Let it be ſo, yet we are ſafe; for his hatred cannot ſtand with the height of his compaſſion, which is our aſſumption.</p>
               <p>Againe he ſaith, [If laying his Mountaines waſte did witneſſe ſuch
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45603:69"/> hatred, did not the giving him thoſe Mountaines teſtifie like love, though not ſo much as to <hi>Iacob?</hi>] Were it ſo, yet we are where we were by his owne confeſſion. <hi>Eſau</hi> was not loved with the height of his compaſſion, becauſe not ſo much as <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides let the Author conſider, were not thoſe ſayings waſte, and ſo Gods hatred of <hi>Eſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for his reiterated calumny, <hi>viz.</hi> that our aſſumption confoundeth the love of compaſſion and delight, it is not worth the naming, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hath appeared; rather he confounds the ſeverall degrees of compaſſion, in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that becauſe every man partaketh of ſome degree of compaſſion, therefore every man muſt partake of the higheſt degree; but this reaſoning can never overthrow our aſſumption, and ſo our argument ſtill holdeth firme.</p>
               <p>I ſhall againe reſume it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe for whom Chriſt died ſo as to procure eternall life for, he loved with height and top of his love.</p>
               <p>But he loveth not every ſon of Adam with the height of his love.</p>

               <p>Thoſe for whom he died, he ſo died in their ſtead, that he did tranſlate the death which they deſerved upon himſelfe, ſo that they died not; thus to (die for) is taken 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>Rom</hi> 5.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3.</p>

               <p>But ſeeing the Argument in the iſſue comes to one head, I ſhall engage in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as he propoundeth it; and firſt I ſhall make the Argument appeare in its native and intended ſtrength. For God not to deale with Chriſt according to the exigence of his merits, and with us according to the merit of our mediatour, as it would in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ench upon the juſtice of God, ſo it is granted by the Author, page 100. Now if Chriſt did undertake for every man, payed his debt, ſatisfied his father juſtice, and tooke away ſinne, and all that ſtood croſſe to our ſalvation, and aboliſhed death; all which he affirmes for every ſonne of Adam: and ſo effectually and actually that it is as good
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45603:70"/> with God as if every man had ſuffered, and died the death due to his ſinne in his owne perſon; for ſo the Author is pleaſed to ſay page 17. certainely then every man ſhould ſtand acquitted from that charge, Gods juſtice ſhould exact no more; for as juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſatisfaction, ſo it requireth but ſatisfaction; the ſame debt is not in juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired both of the ſurety and the principall, and as it had not been agreeing with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to require a ſecond payment, if man had been able to undergoe the wrath of God due to ſinne, and to riſe out of it; ſo is it equally disagreeing to juſtice to require a ſecond payment of any, ſeeing Chriſt hath payed it in his owne perſon. For herein he did not die (for) but die (with) them that ſo die: Hence I conclude that if Chriſt ſatisfied his Fathers juſtice for every man, they ſhould be freed from the curſe due to ſinne, which is to be juſtified, and this by his merits, which is to be juſtified by his blood: this is the genuine face of the argument.</p>

And if any object the uſuall ſtreame of Scripture language, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are juſtified by faith, and he juſtifieth him that beleeveth in Jeſus: by conſidering this diſtinction, we may breake through that, and ſay that that is onely meant of the pronunciation of it according to the tenour of the Goſpel; and the reaſon why though there be ſuch an act in God from eternity, before our faith be wrought in us, yet the Scripture ſpeakes of juſtification through faith, &amp;c. is becauſe as in judiciary affaires it matters not what the Judge reſolveth in his breaſt, though whom he reſolveth to acquit, they may be ſaid to be acquitted; yet men looke at his legall ſentence pronounced; that by the law, the perſon himſelfe, and the ſpectators, is looked at at his abſolution or acquittance.

               <p>That which in this may ſeeme harſh, is [That a man remaining a ſinner may be ſaid to be juſtified;] but if it be well conſidered, it will not appeare more harſh then this. That a man whilſt a ſinner, is elected to life; both are preſt with the ſame pretended abſurdities: Againe God is ſaid to juſtifie the ungodly <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. but this he doth not <hi>(quoad evangelicam promulgationem)</hi> for that is onely to beleevers; but beleevers when ſo, are not branded with the title of ungodly; and may not this, [We are juſtified whileſt enemies,] be received as well as this, [We are reconciled whileſt enemies?] <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. This I commend to the Authors conſideration.</p>
               <p>Againe it is to be enquired into, from what juſtification freeth us; we finde it thus expreſt, <hi>[A peccato &amp; morte]</hi> from ſin and death,<note place="margin">Ames. med.</note> and of this <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> is a ſound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretor: when it is ſaid <hi>(a peccato,)</hi> it is no more then this, <hi>[A paenis peccati]</hi> from the puniſhment of ſinne. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 45. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. <hi>[a reatu peccatorum]</hi> from the guilt of ſinne. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. and that not from the guilt of ſome, or one, but all ſinnes and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>[abſolutio a peccatis &amp; omni condemnatione,]</hi> from ſinnes and all condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. and this Scripture affirmeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. who ſhall lay any thing to their charge? it is God that juſtifieth.

               <p>Theſe being conſidered, I proceed to his anſwers to our Argument. Now becauſe he puts all the untruth upon the Major, I ſhall reſume it in the vigour and ſtrength of it.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45603:71"/> Thoſe whom Chriſt ſatisfied his Fathers juſtice for, they are juſtified in Gods account, and ſhall be juſtified by the manifeſtation of this in time, both in the Goſpel and their owne conſciences, and at laſt be inveſted with eternall life, elſe may Chriſt complaine of injuſtice.</p>
               <p>To this he anſwers. [All the ſtrength of this Argument is in the firſt propoſition with the reaſon annexed unto it.] Then it ſeemes the Minor he giveth for truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that all are not juſtified; but then why hath he contended for this, that all, yee every ſonne of Adam is juſtified in Chriſt, as page 10. 45. But that we may ſee what he hath to ſay againſt the propoſition, he judgeth thus at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. [This is ſo contrary to Scripture, that little need be ſaid; from the compariſon betweene Chriſt and Adam it appeares, that though all men be in the publique perſon Juſtified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet by and through him, of the benefit of that Juſtification doe none partake but ſuch as have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him.]</p>
               <p>If he had ſhowen what Scripture this had beene contrary to, that we might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined thoſe Texts he had done faire, but he would have his Reade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. As for the compariſon betwixt Adam and Chriſt, there was nothing expreſſed by him therein that contradicteth the propoſition; not that prepoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> [none par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the fruits of that juſtification, but ſuch as come to have a being from him,] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all thoſe that he ſatisfied his Fathers juſtice for, ſhall in time to come have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His expreſſes in the compariſon betwixt Adam and Chriſt, are ſo farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting, that they confirme the propoſition: For he ſaith, [Though all men be in the publique perſon juſtified;] doth he not here tacitely grant, that every man by virtue of his death and ranſome as publique perſon to be juſtified in him? and what is this to what the propoſition affirmeth? <hi>viz.</hi> that all he ſatisfied for, are juſtified in or by his blood? for to be juſtified in and by Chriſt are not different, and to be juſtified by Chriſt and by his blood are as little different.</p>
               <p>[Chriſt is ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.] And this nothing againſt us; for we ſay not that all when Chriſt ſatisfied for them, they were juſtified in the pronunciation of the Goſpel, before faith was wought in them, but that ſuch in time ſhall be juſtified and receive the atonement in their hearts; and his expreſſes herein hindreth not; for they ſhall have that faith in his blood whereby they may receive this atonement; againe, true, the evangelicall pronunciation of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is by faith, but how doth he prove that in the minde of God, they are not juſtified before faith?</p>
               <p>[Juſtification is not by blood ſhed onely, but the application of his blood.] His expreſſions are herein ſomething wilde, but I gueſſe at his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus; that juſtification is not till another worke of the Spirit to be done upon the heart: but then I ſay if he meane it as done in the minde of God, it is falſe; if as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the Goſpel, it is true; but beſides, this is nothing againſt the propoſition, becauſe we ſay ſtill, they ſhall have that further worke upon their hearts one time or other; true alſo, many have received this juſtification that once wanted it, and ſome want it that ſhall have it; but what are theſe to the purpoſe of proving that all that Chriſt ſatisfied for, ſhall not one time or other have it? And as for that expreſſion,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45603:71"/>
[Many of his elect want it; for whom by this objection Chriſt ſhould not have died.] Is too abſurd to mention: the objection is farre from urging that he died not for thoſe elect that want this juſtification: but it affirmeth that all ſuch, (though they now want it,) ſhall have it in time.</p>
               <p>[As for that cleanſing 1 <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1.7. and forgiveneſſe verſe. 9 it ſpeakes of a further cleanſing &amp;c. to ſuch as are in Chriſt, and alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy juſtified by his blood; and ſo not to this purpoſe.] More pertinent Texts might be produced to prove the propoſition, but this Text is not ſo deficient as as he conceived when he cited it: for, whereas he ſpeaketh of a further cleanſing, it is hard to gueſſe at his meaning; further then that, he muſt meane one of theſe two, or both; further then juſtification, or a cleanſing further then that which is by the bloodſhed of Chriſt; but both theſe are falſe; that it ſpeakes of cleanſing from guilt by juſtification, appeares by ver. 9. where it expounds it by forgiving our ſinnes, and that is ſuch as is by bloodſhed, appeares in that it is by the blood of Chriſt; and what though it ſpeak of them that are actually juſtified? it ſaith it is by the blood of Chriſt, that is the meritorious cauſe; and this is not impertinent to the buſineſſe in hand, but proveth the propoſition: that thoſe for whom the blood of Chriſt ſatisfied his Father, they came in time to be cleanſed from their ſins by that blood.</p>
               <p>[This untruth is not onely falſe and groſſe in it ſelfe, but denyes many ſayings of Scripture, as <hi>Iohn,</hi> 3.17.18. &amp; 8.24.] Had the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor produced Texts wherein his managing might be more perſpicuous, or diſcover where his meaning lies in theſe, I ſhould have a clearer way for a reply. I have ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enquired after the intention of the Author in theſe Texts, and my thoughts I have brought to this reſult, it may be with greater force then he intended, and it is this, <hi>John,</hi> 3.17. Chriſt is ſaid to ſave the world; yet <hi>John,</hi> 16.8.11. he is ſaid to convince the world of ſinne; and <hi>John,</hi> 8.23.24. ye ſhall die in your ſinnes; by theſe it appeareth that all that he died for and ſaveth, are not juſtified and ſaved from wrath; and this may ſeeme a ſpecious allegation; but it hath little in it. For, by (World) in the Authors judgement is meant every Sonne of Adam; ſo that <hi>Iohn,</hi> 3.16. ſaith he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 16.8.11. ſaith he ſhall convince the world, that is in both, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſonne of Adam; and ſo he would have theſe places compared, to prove that as he came to ſave every man, ſo he ſhall ſave never a man, for every man that ſhall be convinced of ſin, becauſe they beleeve not; this indeed oppoſeth the propoſition, but no reaſonable man can judge to be the meaning of thoſe Texts; therefore to reply.</p>

                  <hi>John,</hi> 3.18. doth not ſay that they which he came to ſave were not ſo in time, nor that Text <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.8.11. doth not ſay be ſatisfied his Fathers juſtice for them that ſhould be convinced of ſin and ſo periſh: therefore how theſe Texts can diſprove the propoſition I ſee not.</p>
               <p>[It overthroweth many affirmations in the Scripture, as that all ſhall beare the image of the firſt Adam, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.46. that all are dead in ſin by nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. that God juſtifieth the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. &amp;c.] It cannot but be judged too great a prodigality of time and paines to inſiſt upon ſuch jejune and empty expreſſions, that have not the leaſt ſhew of reaſon; but the nature of my Antagoniſt requireth it: doth the propoſition ſay that all doe not beare the image of the earthy? certainely no. It ſuppoſeth the contrary that all doe; for it ſaith, that all that Chriſt died for, ſhall in time partake of the Image of the heavenly, which intimateth that all at firſt beare the Image of the earthy. Juſtification doth not immediately reflect upon the being of ſinne, but obligation to puniſhment; and this may ſuffice for the two firſt Texts alledged by him. As for <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. it ſpeaketh not of ſuch a juſtification as is by faith; it ſpeaketh of beleeving on him that juſtifieth he ungodly, but not of his juſtifying the ungodly upon their beleeving; therefore he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledgeth that Text; he is ſaid to juſtifie the ungodly; but beleevers are never called ſo; eſpecially if he reflect upon his owne ſenſe of ungodly, page 10. beſides the Text ſheweth not that all the ungodly be juſtified, doe not in time come to partake of life: hitherto I ſee nothing of ſtrength againſt the propoſition.</p>
               <p>As for that counterpart to the propoſition, which he produceth page 96. <hi>viz.</hi> [many for whom Chriſt died remaine without that juſtification that is in him,] wants proof; for thoſe Texts alledged doe not make it appeare that Chriſt died for ſuch as want that juſtification and never partake of it.</p>
               <p>The next thing that he ſtumbleth at, is the ſecond part of the propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> [All for whom he ſatisfied ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him;] this he preſently cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe as falſe and contrary to Scripture. But what Text? [2 <hi>Peter.</hi> 2.1.2.] This text I have ſpoken of formerly, and cleared it from overthrowing the propoſition; it ſpeaketh not not a word of ſatisfying his Fathers juſtice for them.</p>
               <p>[And this untruth denieth the Lordſhip of Chriſt, grounded on his death for all.]</p>
               <p>But wherein it denieth it he ſhoweth not; doe we by ſaying all that he ſatisfied for ſhall be ſaved, deny him to be Lord of all? as if he could not be their Lord unleſſe he ſave them from wrath to come? weak argument! and of this ſtamp are the reſt that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, clearely confuted in ſeverall pages of this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoken of the two parts of the propoſition, he cometh to the reaſon by which the propoſition is backed; and he hath ſomething to ſay to that as followeth; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if he doe not juſtifie and ſave from wrath all thoſe for whoſe ſinnes he hath ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſhould be unjuſt; to this be anſwers. [A preſumptuous raſhneſſe in an intimate charging God with injuſtice.] But where lieth the raſhneſſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſaying if ſuch a thing be granted he is unjuſt, or in affirming ſuch, the granting whereof maketh him to be unjuſt? let the Author judge. Let us ſee what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith page, 97. [That were injuſtice not onely to require the whole debt againe, but even any part of it, either of him or any other that are diſcharged by him, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from him or his any thing that by vertue of his ranſome is to be conferred.] So
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45603:72"/> that we ſee it is no ſuch charging God with injuſtice as he pretendeth, to ſay that if ſuch a thing be granted God is unjuſt; but beſides, let us conſider it is injuſtice in God to require any part of the debt againe of Chriſt, or any other for whom Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and was diſcharged, or any that are diſcharged for Chriſt; for ſo both are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alike; now let us conſider the Authors words page 4. [All the ſinnes the law could charge mankinde withall were imputed to him; he ſuffered the curſe, and died as the ſinner, and roſe acquit of all our ſinnes, and a triumphant victor over ſin and death.] Let him tell us, is it not injuſtice in his own language to require part of this debt or all of Chriſt or any for whom he ſtood, and died, and of whoſe ſinnes he ſtood acquitted? But he ſaith he did ſo for every ſonne of Adam, therefore doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the reaſon of the propoſition, and ſhow the vanity of this his raſh charge.</p>
               <p>But he thinketh to preſſe the reaſon of the propoſition with an abſurdity.</p>
               <p>[Gods children have complained of trouble by the law in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. and he ſaith of his own children, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 89.32. I will viſit their ſinnes with ſtripes.] Wherein it ſeemeth ſtrange that the Authors ignorance ſhould put God to his purgatories to clear his juſtice; but it is an eaſie thing to cleare his juſtice, in that his people have both ſinnes and ſufferings: when yet it would be too cleare if they ſhould not have eternall life, becauſe Chriſt did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that they ſhould be taken out of an eſtate of ſinne preſently, or freed from all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall afflictions, to correct, reduce, warne themſelves and others; but that they ſhould be in part renewed, and at laſt come to life; but he in ſatisfying Gods juſtice for them did actually free them from the curſe due to ſin, which is eternall death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to puniſh any ſuch with eternall death would entrench on his juſtice. I ſay not that temporall ſufferings is indured as ſatisfactions for ſinnes. I leave that ſoppery to the Authors; neither doe I ſay they are no puniſhments but corrections; but I ſay they are caſtigatory puniſhments, not ſatisfactions; and thus to ſay is no way contradictory to any of thoſe Texts quoted page 98. all which ſhew as they were puniſhments, ſo they were for caſtigation and correction onely, not ſatisfaction, as the eternall torments of them that periſh are; but ſo weakely are his Texts quoted all along, as if he intended to make the word of God ſeeme vile.</p>
               <p>The text by which we prove the propoſition, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. [If whilſt enemies wee were reconciled by the death of his Sonne, much more being reconciled ſhall wee be ſaved by his life.] To this he thus anſwereth, [It ſaith not that all Chriſt died for &amp;c. ſhall be ſaved by his life; but ſpeaking of Beleevers &amp;c. they ſhould much more be ſaved by his life.] Which is a meere ſhift, and no handſome one neither. For let us but ſeriouſly conſider he makes reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his death is of equall extent, if we were reconciled by his death, and ſo doth the Author. Secondly, he maketh reconciliation and ſalvation of equall extent; nay with a (much more) meaning that is not ſo great an abſurdity to ſay we are not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by his death, as to ſay, that being reconciled we ſhall not be ſaved; then let him conſider, doth it not ſtrongly intimate that all that he died for and ſo reconciled, ſhall be ſaved by his life? as for that gloſſe, [But ſpeaking of Beleevers he ſaith that much more they ſhall be ſaved.] It is a perverſion of a cleare Text; for it ſaith not [Much more ſhall we beleevers be ſaved,] which it would have been, if his perverſion had beene right; but it is much more, we being reconciled, not, [wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,] but [we reconciled;] their confidence of ſalvation was deduced not from
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45603:73"/> their condition of beleeving; but what Chriſt hath done by dying, <hi>viz.</hi> reconciled them, and this drawne from the connexion betwixt his death and reconciliation, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and ſalvation, which cleareth the propoſition.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which he chargeth the reaſon annexed to the propoſition, with, is [Groſſe ignorance in the end of Chriſts death as the price.] Of which he ſaith thus. [It was not that by that act without any more done by him, men ſhould be preſently poſſeſſed of all that juſtification, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from death, enjoyment of life in him.] How he diſcovereth his owne ignorance, to make the ignorance of his advantage knowne? he diſcovers ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the nature of juſtification; for that expreſſion, [Be poſſeſſed of all that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,] implieth that juſtification is ſucceſſive, and reteined by degrees, which is falſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of his adverſaries meaning, which is not that preſently they ſhould enjoy life without any more done; but that in time they ſhall have life and that ſpirituall worke which leadeth to it; therefore he is either ignorant, or perverſe thus to ſay.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we be ignorant in the end of Chriſts death, I beleeve he will not informe us; he ſaith thus [That he might be the Lord of all men, that he might have all releaſed to him, and have pardon in his hands, and ſpirit and life to beſtow as he thinketh fit, that he hight juſtifie them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and harden and adjudge the reſidue to a ſecond death.] In which diſcovery he ſavours more of Arminian ſcripture then of ſacred Scriptures; thus they define the impetration, by the death of Chriſt. <hi>[Eſt restitutio in talem ſtatum quo non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante juſtitia deus de novo beneficia communicare poteſt &amp; vult eâ lege &amp; modo quo ipſi videtur.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If Chriſt came to ſave them that beleeve, and condemne them that beleeve not, then a joynt end of his death was to condemne contrary to <hi>John,</hi> 3.17. I came not to condemne.</p>

               <p n="5">5. That phraſe (as he thinketh fit,) importeth that Chriſt in his death did not pitch upon a way by which he would ſave, but left it indifferent whether by faith or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; if he hold that Chriſt by death procured life by faith in Chriſt, then he is too remiſſe in that expreſſion as he thinketh fit: how many exceptions are his words herein liable to and diſcover little knowledge in the Author? in this buſineſſe I have ſhowne Chapter 3. that the maine end ſo farre as it relateth to man, is to give eternall life, and all thoſe are but intermediate ends as to become their Lord, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for that which he produceth as one end, <hi>viz.</hi> ſatiſfaction of his Fathers juſtice, it is not intended for it ſelfe, but for ſomething further; now what can he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend leſſe in ſatisfying his Fathers juſtice, then that they for whom he ſo did ſhould not anſwer or ſuffer for any of thoſe ſinnes? doth then, to ſay that all thoſe for whom he ſo ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>[If Chriſt ſtrive in the meanes, and they be found hardning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it increaſeth their debt; and if he puniſh, he is juſt.] True, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſts death never procured an immunity from temporall puniſhments, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we ſhould have them to correct and reduce us.</p>
               <p>[And if he ſtill ſtrive and they refuſe, if he give them over to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, is he not juſt?] If he have received ſatisfaction for that unbeleife, (as he hath if that be true which the Author ſaith, page 4. that he was charged with all the ſinnes the law could charge man with; certainely then with all the Goſpel could) then his juſtice ſeemeth blemiſht in damning them for it; eternall death is not correctory, but ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>[Unbeliefe is the maine ſinne, &amp;c. and this is the debt which God requires, &amp;c. ſo that here is not two payments of one debt; but a new debt in deſpiſing Gods goodneſſe.] I demand when he ſaith, [Chriſt ſatisfied for ſinne,] what ſinne he means? what onely for originall, and leſt us to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for actuall? or for ſome actuall, and left us to makt out the reſt? Was the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife of <hi>Paul,</hi> in the time of non converſion, a new debt not ſatisfied for? can any be ſaved and their ſinnes not ſatisfied for? is any able to ſatisfie but Chriſt? and the ſinner be capable of life? O impious doctrine, derogatory to the ſufferings of Chriſt; is not Chriſts worke a perfect worke, but a man may have a new debt, that was not thought on by Chriſt? ſtrange divinity, how muſt the deare children of God do with their paſt rebellions againſt meanes of grace? it is a new debt Chriſt ſatisfied not, they are not able? doth not he doe well to charge others with groſſe ignorance, that he may have ſome fellowes? Hath he ſo ſoone forgot his proteſtation againſt popery, and to defend the doctrine of the church of <hi>England</hi> againſt all popiſh innovation, which doctrine runnes thus</p>
               <p>[That Chriſt ſuffered for all ſinnes of men, originall and actuall.] Yet he comes with a new debt unſatisfyed for, and who muſt if Chriſt did not? I would have the Author tell me what he meaneth when he ſaith, [The whole debt of mankinde became his, page 3.] is not contempt of meanes and rebellion againſt Gods call part of our debt? certainely herein the Author diſcovered too much ignorance, with which he is pleaſed to brand others; certainely thoſe for whom Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, he ſatisfyed for all their ſinnes, originall, actuall, againſt Law, againſt Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; his ſatisfaction was not done to the halfe to need a corrivall in that worke; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch can have no new debt, and ſuch cannot in juſtice be bound over to ſuffer eternall torments for any ſinne, no not for any pretended new debt; he hath taken away all that ſtands croſſe to our ſalvation; ſo the Author ſpeaketh, page 18. 19.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the fourth Objection.</head>
               <p>A Fourth Argument is this.</p>
               <p>Thoſe to whom he would not vouchſafe to manifeſt himſelfe, or to pray for, for thoſe he would not die. <hi>John.</hi> 17.9.</p>
               <p>But he would not manifeſt himſelfe to, nor pray for the world of ungodly and wicked men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> He did not die for the world of ungodly or wicked men.]</p>
               <p>Before I come to his anſwers, I ſhall take notice of his dealing with the argument to make it fit for his purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He confoundeth two arguments together; for [Manifeſtation of him ſelf,] that belongeth to an other argument; neither can he give any preſident of jumbling theſe two together, which confuſion will make the argument not clear, and the anſwers obſcure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He cannot produce any that citeth <hi>John,</hi> 17.9. to prove the Major.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor any that maketh the Minor to runne thus. [But he prayed not for the world of ungodly; or the concluſion to run thus. [<hi>Ergo,</hi> [He dyed not for the world of ungodly,] all theſe are purpoſely foyſted in to make the argument ſeeme vile; this is no faithfull dealing as he promiſed, the argument runneth thus, in the ſeventh Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Hag. Col.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe whom he reconciled he interceded for. <hi>John.</hi> 17.9.</p>
               <p>But He interceded not for all and every ſon of Adam. <hi>John.</hi> 17.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> He reconciled not every ſonne of Adam. <hi>John.</hi> 17.9.</p>
               <p>The Major is thus grounded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. he ſaith, [If he give us his Sonne, he wil much more give us all things,] The Argument is this, if he gave us the greater, he will certainely much more give us the leſſe; ſo if he die for us, he will pray for us; ſo in the negative we conclude, if he pray not for the world which is the leſſe, he did not die for or reconcile which is the greater. Now to perpend his anſwers, he giveth this generall and facile refutation. [This objection is falſe many waies.] And that which he driveth at I gueſſe to be the ground of the reaſon, that is the ground of proceeding from the leſſe to the greater negatively, that he would prove it is no good reaſon to ſay becauſe he would not pray, therefore he would not die for the world, and he urgeth thus.</p>
               <p>[It is not right reaſon to ſay God would not make Heaven, &amp;c. whom he would not preſerve in that good eſtate.] But had he beene in his right reaſon he would have ſeen this very impertinent to our purpoſe; our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeds from the leſſe to the greater negatively; but his inſtance proceedeth from the greater to the leſſe negatively: which is unſound and quite contrary to the buſineſſe in hand; for to preſerve in a good eſtate is a greater mercy then to create in ſuch eſtate onely; ſo that though this is not ſound, he will not create becauſe he will not preſerve; yet this is good, if he will not create which is the leſſe, he will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45603:74"/> which is the greater; and this ſerveth us, the leſſe may include the greater nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, but the greater cannot the leſſe.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe expreſſes that touch that part of the argument, <hi>viz.</hi> [the manifeſting of himſelfe to the world,] it is not to this argument; which mixture of Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſſes will pertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>be the reader in the cleare deciſion of this argument; therefore I wave them. Againe he urgeth.</p>
               <p>[If Chriſt had ſaid he never did nor would pray for the world, (which he never ſaid) yet it were evill in us to uſe that as an argument to deny the truth of his own words as that he dyed for all and every one.] But rather an evill in himſelfe, to obtrude ſuch a ſenſe on thoſe places that contradict Chriſts owne words, or the true conſequences from the ſame; it is no evill in us to gaineſay the phanſy or gloſſe that the Author puts on thoſe Texts: from this I can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little, but that the Author would have all the ſayings of our Saviour to take the modell of their interpretations from his own conceits upon thoſe places. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. which is not a reaſonable poſtulatum; as for that parentheſis (which he did not) if he once ſaid he did not, and it cannot be proved that ever he did pray for that world, we may preſume he meaneth, he never had nor would pray for them.</p>
               <p>[This confoundeth his love of compaſſion, common to all, and of delight peculiar to Beleevers.] It is hard to divine his meaning herein, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he meaneth that his dying for, be only the love of compaſſion, and his (praying for) the love of delight; and ſo to pray for us, to be a greater love then dying for us; for ſo he maketh the love of delight to be the greateſt love; but this is not apparent by any Scripture; and how this argument confoundeth compaſſion and delight, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have done well to have diſcovered to them that ſee it not.</p>
               <p>[This confoundeth the death of Chriſt as ranſome (for all) and his advocation that is onely for Beleevers.] I know the Authors underſtanding is not able to reach the difference betwixt confounding, and (not dividing;) the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument contends for the non dividing of his death and advocation, but not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them; the argument and them that forme it hold it diſtinct. But we would have his advocation and death to be to the ſame perſons, and ſo his death and ranſome not for all and every ſonne of Adam. 2. Whereas he ſaith, his advocation is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to beleevers, I conclude he hath loſt part of his leſſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſtinction of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> of Advocation into generall and ſpeciall; for without this how will he free himſelfe from a contradiction, in that he ſaith here, that his advocation is peculiar to beleevers? yet he contendeth page 110. 111. that he prayed for the world, <hi>John,</hi> 9.21. for tranſgreſſors, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 53.12. for crucifiers, <hi>Luke,</hi> 23.34. all which he oppoſeth to elect and beleevers. 3. How his advocation is proper to beleevers, (that is in act) I ſee not, becauſe he prayed for ſome that after ſhould beleeve, and therefore then did not, ver. 22. 4. That his advocation is proper to beleevers, (that is ſuch as are or ſhall be) I grant; but then why his oblation ſhould be of larger extent I ſee not; they are joyned acts in his mediatourſhip, the one ſhedding,<note place="margin">Col Hag. in Arg.</note> the other preſenting that blood as ſhed. Hence the Remonſtrants grant, <hi>[pro omnibus Chriſtum imercedere ut pontifices ejus typi ſolebant,]</hi> and theſe acts are never diſjoyned but connected, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.1.2. for him to appeare on earth for them for whom he appeareth not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Scripture owneth not: and if he can prove Chriſt to have interceded for all, I for my part ſhall grant him to have offered blood for all; and ſeeing he granteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſion
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45603:75"/> to be peculiar, ſo ſhall I conclude oblation alſo, they being both of the ſame latitude; and whereas he ſaith, [This confoundeth ranſome (for all) and advocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for beleevers] is a weake confutation, becauſe in in it there is <hi>(petitio principii)</hi> a ſuppoſing that his ranſome is for all and every man, which is yet <hi>(ſub judice,)</hi> nay cleare to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Yet upon this weake bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ery, he can after his uſuall cuſtome manfully conclude that, [The whole argument is fallen without further anſwer.] But why doth he attempt workes of ſupererogation, in producing ſo many leaves in a buſineſſe that is done allready? but his meaning is, (as much as it will with all the reſt that follow;) he then attempt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to anſwer that Text <hi>Rom</hi> 8.32. wherein the ſtrength of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition lieth, and from it we urge, if he gave us his Sonne, his Sonne will give us his prayers; if not the latter, not the former; to this he thus anſwers.</p>
               <p>[This is not ſpoken in the third perſon, nor of ranſome onely, nor as a propoſition to bring men in to beleeve.] This antidote like an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke he applieth to every Text, not conſidering how it is applied to the conſtitution of the ſame; for what though it be not in the third perſon, the conſequence is good, that to whom he giveth his Sonne, to them he giveth all things, and that as firme as if the words had runne thus; [If he hath given his Sonne to every man, how ſhall he not with him give them all things,] what perſon ſoever it be ſpoken in, firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or third; yet this is firme, that if he give the greater gift, he will not be niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a leſſe: the argument of confidence is not drawne from the perſons to whom, but the gift that was given. 2. Whereas he ſaith, that this phraſe (He hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him up for us all,) meaneth not of ranſome onely, it is falſe and contrary to any common underſtanding; it is cleare that theſe words relate to his death in which he is ſaid to be delivered up for us.</p>
               <p>But he urgeth further.</p>
               <p>[It ſerveth not the propoſition; for it ſaith not, how ſhall he not freely give us all things? but how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things? ſo ſpeaking of his free giving him to us, and with him all things.] A wiſe interpretor would ſtand the Author in much ſtead, to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his meaning herein; the difference betwixt, [Shall he not give us all things,] and this, [Shall he not with him give us all things] is very obſcure; and had he kept his owne councell, we ſhould have remained expectants of ſome rare diſcovery; but from page 107. we may gather what his abuſe of the Text is, and what he meaneth by this phraſe, [With him give us all things,] there I finde this expreſſe. [They now by beleeving receit having Chriſt and in him life, and being ſonnes thereby, which giveth hope of all good, he concludeth, having freely given us this his owne Sonne, (whom before he delivered up for us,) how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?] So that hence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his evaſion is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that phraſe, [With him,] ſpeakes of ſuch a giving his Sonne, as conſiſts in giving his Spirit, by bringing them in to beleeve; and being ſo, a beeing made ſonnes, and having adoption, and thus having him given us, with him thus given we ſhall have all things; but this is injurious to the Text many wayes, as 1. Then the ſenſe muſt be thus, having the Sonne and all things with him, how ſhall he not with him give us all things? this would be abſurd. Let the Author tell me
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45603:75"/> what thingt are they of which he concludes upon the having of Chriſt; are they not all thoſe things mentioned in the Chapter? as redemption of our body, ver. 23. ſpirit to helpe infirmities, ver. 26. the utility of all things for good, v. 28. conformity to his Sonne, ver. 29. vocation, juſtification, glorification: yea as as a ſtrong Remonſtrant affirmeth, <hi>[Omnia quae ſpectant ad vocationem &amp; glorificationem noſtram.]</hi> Certainely then if vocation and ſpirit,<note place="margin">Cornel. A lapid. in locum.</note> be thoſe things that he concludeth from Chriſts being given, then thoſe things are not included in that giving of Chriſt; then it would meane thus; if we have vocation and ſpirit, how ſhall he not with thoſe things give us thoſe things? but this ſenſe I leave to the Author. 2. Is it not as cleare as the light that this phraſe [with him] is no more but with him ſo delivered up for us? there is no mentioning of a giving of Chriſt as diſtinct from his being delivered up for us, as he ſuggeſts. 3. This would intimate that to be brought in to beleeve, is ſet out in Scripture by this phraſe of having Chriſt (given for us,) or having given (to us,) but this I no where finde; where Chriſt is ſaid to be given either by his Father or himſelf, it relateth to his death and ranſome, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Luk</hi> 22.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where this phraſe, (delivered up for us) is uſed, that is moſt cleare, that word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I never read (when ſpoken of Chriſt) in an other ſenſe: but when the Scripture ſpeaketh of giving faith, confidence, Sonſhip, or any of the choice benefits, it ſaith not, he giveth his (Son) but his (Spirit) <hi>Luke,</hi> 11.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4 8. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.6. the difference is cleare on both parts. He ſent his Sonne, verſe 4. He ſent the ſpirit of his Sonne, ver. 6. So that it is cleare that the Apoſtle draweth this concluſion, not from the receipt of the Spirit of Chriſt in beleeving, but from Chriſts being delivered up for them to die; and good ground: for grace ſaith Sonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, glory; all come ſhort of Chriſt himſelfe; and the argument is ſtrong from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the leſſe; and doth not all that he ſaith appeare rather to pervert, then to ſatisfie the Text?</p>
               <p>Thus having done with the propoſition, he invadeth the aſſumption which is, [That he did not intercede for every man, <hi>John,</hi> 17.9.].</p>
               <p>Now againſt this he thus ſaith, [That doth not ſay the world of wicked and ungodly men, as the aſſumption ſaith.] Neither doth the aſſumption ſay ſo, but when it is altered and corrupted by himſelfe; we ſay he prayed not for every ſon of Adam; we have no reaſon to ſay he prayed not for the world of ungodly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the wicked and ungodly are not of that world of ungodly that was excluded his prayers.</p>
               <p>But he further ſaith thus, [The word (world) ver. 9. includeth all the Elect that were in and of the world, and uncalled forth and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that for the ſame things for which he prayed for them that did beleeve, ver. 6.9. he prayeth for the ſame, for them that after ſhould beleeve on him, ver. 20.] The contrary whereof doth clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; for if at the ſame time he prayed for the ſame things, for ſome elect and yet uncalled home, ver. 20. it is cleare that when he excluded the world from his prayers, that word (world) doth not take in the elect uncalled, for whom he prayeth, ver. 20. for then ſuch muſt be both prayed for, and yet excluded his prayers, at the ſame time, and for the ſame things; herein he doth implicate himſelfe. But rather the word (world) is meant of thoſe unregenerate men, that neither did nor afterwards ſhould beleeve in him; for ſuch he prayed not for faith, or union, or perſeverance, or glory.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45603:76"/> As for that which followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> [All the way from ver. 9. to 21. there is no petition for any thing, for any before they beleeve, or yet might bring them in to beleeve. [Which is falſe, if he meane neither expreſly, nor implicitely; for implicitely he prayed for faith, whereby they are made one with Chriſt and the Father, unleſſe the Author will ſay that Chriſt prayed that ſuch as did not beleeve, might be one with him, without the conſideration of faith, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive; certainely in praying for the end, he prayed for the meanes incluſively.</p>
               <p>But he further urgeth.</p>
               <p>[So that the aſſumption rendring the word [World] for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, non elect oppoſed to elect, maketh two ſorts of elect, one ſort prayed for verſe 9. another ſort prayed for verſe 20.] Theſe words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve hiſſing, rather then a ſolicitous anſwering, and cannot be reduced to common reaſon; we may affirme the elect prayed for, though in a diverſe ſtate and condition, the elect beleeving, ver: 9. the elect unbeleeving, ver. 20. and this without abſurdity; but then we oppoſe not the elect to the non elect, but beleevers to ſuch as yet do not beleeve, both being elect; neither doe we oppoſe but diſtinguiſh them; we may clearely ſee two ſorts of men. 1. Such as are prayed for, and they are ſuch as did for the preſent or afterwards ſhould beleive: ſuch as did ver. 9. ſuch as ſhould, ver. 20.2. Such as are excluded his prayers, and they muſt be ſuch as they neither did nor ſhould; and I may urge, if by (world) he meaneth elect unbeleeving, then Chriſt did exclude ſuch his prayers. But this is falſe from ver. 20.</p>
               <p>[Or elſe it granteth a ſort of people in the world, that are neither of the world nor of the elect.] But this he ſpake at a venture without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall againe reaſſume the parts: thoſe prayed for ver. 9. were elect called out of the world; thoſe prayed for ver. 20. were elect uncalled, yet to be called; thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his prayers ver. 9. were non elect, of the world and never to be taken out of it; now let him cleare up his ſight, and tell me if we make a ſort of men that are neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect nor of the world; but this ſerveth with the reſt to fill paper and puzzle his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Reader.</p>
               <p>As alſo that which followeth.</p>
               <p>[Which way ſoever the aſſumption will have it, it holds forth this falſehood, that none of the elect were, are, or ſhall be beholden to the prayers of Chriſt for all or any of that patience &amp;c. extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith; or for the meanes of grace, by which they are brought in to beleeve, or for faith, ſeeing no ſuch thing is prayed for here for any but the world, verſe 21.23.] Wherein theſe two things are granted and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. 1. That Chriſt prayeth for patience, meanes of grace, faith, for the world, oppoſed to ſuch as beleeve, ver. 9. or ſhould beleeve, ver. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. 2. That he prayed not for faith, &amp;c. for any but that world,] both theſe are falſe; the firſt is falſe, upon this ground, he excluding that world from his prayers, for unity with the Father and the Sonne, would not pray for faith by which they are to be made one; certainely if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the end, he doth exclude from the meanes. 2. How Chriſt ſhould pray for them that neither did nor ſhould after beleeve, any that acknowledgeth Chriſts prayers not to be fruſtrate cannot comprehend. 3. This is grounded on the 21. ver. where it ſaith, [That the world may beleeve,] and ſo from hence he urgeth that Chriſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45603:76"/> did pray for faith for the world: ſo preſuming that the word (beleeve) meanes ſaving ſaith, by which we are made one with God and ſo ſaved. But this is not cleare. I conceive it onely meant of conviction of the minde, and making them to know, as ver. 23. expounds it as the Devils may doe, and ſuch as neither doe nor ſhall beleeve; of the like nature is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. laſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.13. The ſecond is falſe; for either he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for faith for them, ver. 20. which were not of the world, excluded, ver. 9. or elſe he prayed for oneneſſe with himſelfe, and glory without faith; this latter is improbable.</p>
               <p>But he further urgeth,</p>
               <p>[The Text ſaith not he will not, but in the preſent tenſe, in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time its not in the preterfective tenſe, or future tenſe.] This is a very empty evaſion; for if he once ſaid, I pray not for the (world) [and that indifinitely, without ſuch limitations as the Author pretendeth; as [for theſe things] or [at this time,] which if he had thus ſaid [I pray not for the world at this time, or for theſe things;] this evaſion had ſome colour:] but when he ſaith I pray not for the (world,) and that it cannot be produced either before or after that he did pray for them, it is no better then preſumption to conclude that either he did it before or after pray for the world.</p>
               <p>But to this he oppoſeth.</p>
               <p>[He did pray for ſuch as were none of thoſe prayed for verſe 9.20. even for tranſgreſſors, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 53.12. crucifyers, <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.34.] This is the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Let us now view his anſwers.</p>
               <p>[This firſt propoſition is contrary to Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 26.] But this very weakely, becauſe thoſe Texts ſpeake not of the connexion betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers election, and ſons redemption, wherein the ſtrength of the propoſition lyeth, and that from the oneneſſe of his will with the Fathers; therefore thoſe Texts cannot be contradicted by the propoſition.</p>
               <p>[If to poſſeſſe men of the inheritance had been the firſt and onely end of Chriſt his death and ranſome, there might have beene ſome colour to have pauſed on this falſe and bold aſſertion; but that is already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

That he might gather in one all the children of God, <hi>John.</hi> 17.10. That they might be ſanctified through the truth. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.

                  </gap> the blood of ſprinkling, ſprinkled upon all them for whom it was ſhed. So, not ours in affirming, but his in denying the maine end of his death to be to poſſeſſe men of grace and glory, is the bold and falſe aſſertion, and therefore by his own confeſſion there is more ſtrength in the propoſition then he everteth.</p>
               <p>But in his afterwards, we have a taſte of his reaſon.</p>
               <p>[There belongs more then Chriſts death and ranſome, to bring men to the inheritance.]</p>
               <p>But is this a good reaſon to prove, that to bring men to poſſeſſe the inheritance is not the maine end of Chriſt death? he leaneth to the reaſon of <hi>Corvinus,</hi> that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not mans ſalvation abſolutely, becauſe he willeth to ſave him by faith; the non ſatisfaction I have already diſcovered; ſhall we ſay that habitation and dwelling is not the maine end of laying the foundation and perfecting the outſide of my houſe, becauſe there is ſomething more requiſite to my dwelling in it, as cleanſing, adorning, furniſhing? this would he weake reaſoning.</p>
               <p>[The Scripture ſaith he died, &amp;c. that he might be Lord of quick and dead.]</p>
               <p>Admit it, yet Scripture nowhere ſaith that that is the maine end of his death; nay his Lordſhip and power is but ſubſervient to a further end, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring them to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>John,</hi> 17.2. He gave him power over all fleſh, that be might give eternall life, &amp;c. So that hitherto whether the objection deſerve abhorring, or his anſwers hiſſing, let any judge.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds to examine thoſe Texts that are by himſelfe produced, as proving the propoſition, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.29.30. <hi>Ephſ.</hi> 1.3. to 11. which places I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be applied to this article of Redemption; but in Election, there we ſhall finde this golden chaine uſed; therefore I am not engaged to juſtifie them, as holding forth the ſtrength of the propoſition; yet if any have to that end quoted them, I ſhall gueſſe at their drift herein, and free them from his reſponſory cavils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.29.30. Their thoughts on this place I conceive to be theſe, Gods foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, praedeſtination, vocation, juſtification, glorification, yea redemption are connected in the ſame perſons, as in a chaine, and of equall latitude and extent; the top of that chain is his foreknowledge and praedeſtination, and all the reſt runnes in equipage with them; Chriſt is ſo one in will with his Father, that he would not redeem any but whom his Father foreknew and praedeſtinated to it; his Father ſo conſtant to himſelf, that he calleth, juſtifieth, glorifieth thoſe and only thoſe whom he fore knew and praedeſtinated; he worketh according to his purpoſe:</p>
               <p>That we may underſtand this more fully, we muſt conſider that the buſineſſe which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45603:78"/> the Apoſtle is to make cleare is this. [That all things, even afflictions ſhall worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good to them that are called of his purpoſe,] this he layeth downe ver. 28. now the words that follow are to make this good, as appeares by the word (For) ver. 29, now that which worketh this good is this, [Such ſhall be glorified,] ſuch as are called ſhall come to glory, that all afflictions that are to them in <hi>[Serie mediorum]</hi> a ſeries of meanes to that end, ſhall further not impede their glorification, therefore ſhall worke together for good. But this then is to be proved, that thoſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhall be glorified, and he proveth it by this, ſuch were foreknown and predeſtinated to glory; ſo that they that are called may looke backward to Gods predeſtination, and foreward to their glorification; ſuch as were predeſtinated, ſuch ſhall be glorified; but then further this muſt be proved that thoſe that were predeſtinated, ſhall be glorified; this he proveth by the contiguity and connexion of all thoſe linkes in that golden chain; whom he foreknew, he predeſtinated, whom predeſtinated, them he called, whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, them he juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fied; whom he juſtified, them he glorified: &amp; ſo they that love God and are called, may conclude they were predeſtinated, they ſhall be glorified; and hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all things ſhall worke together for good, and therefore they conclude for many priviledges to themſelves, v. 31.32.33.34.35. ſome whereof are, he gave him for us to death, ver. 33. It is Chriſt that is dead, ver. 34. all which they had by vertue of Gods predeſtination, or election, ver. 33. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? I ſhould willing imbrace a better coherence and ſenſe of the place, and if this be the right it doth ſtrengthen the propoſition. That ſeeing all things that are <hi>in Serie mediorum,</hi> as meanes conducing to ſalvation, beare an equipage to his election, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt is not to exceede it. And ſo for <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3 to 11. there is an ennu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of priviledges from election, ver. 3. to glorification, ver. 11. but election lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the way, and bounds all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now to examine what he anſwers to theſe.</p>
               <p>[This is a far fetched inference, evading the buſineſſe in hand; for the buſineſſe oppoſed in the inference, is the redemption made by Chriſt in his own body for men; and thoſe places mentioned, ſpeak of the benefits thereof, &amp;c. yea ſuch as many beleevers want.]</p>
               <p>Firſt here is a falſity; becauſe it is cleare <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. ſpeaketh of the ranſome of Chriſt and of what he did for men in his body; He was delivered up for us, and died for us, ver. 34. and whether doth the expreſſion denote his death or the benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? (Secondly,) ſuppoſe it doe, yet cleare it is that all there mentioned, and ſo all that tend to ſalvation, are but equall with his election, which confirmeth the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is rather a cavill then ſatisfaction. Againe he ſaith thus,</p>
               <p>[Neither it is ſaid doth and will juſtifie and glorifie, but did and hath predeſtinated, called, glorified, which I hope none will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme of all the elect, much leſſe of all Chriſt died for.] Wherein he diſcovereth but a groſſe underſtanding of the Text, I hope he will not ſo limit the ſenſe of it, as that it ſhall come ſhort of truth; for all whom he hath predeſtinated, he hath not yet called: all whom he hath called, he hath not yet glorified them. Let the Author ſpeake, hath he called and glorified all whom he hath foreknowne or predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, or much more had he glorified all that he had predeſtinated, when the Apoſtle ſpake theſe words? he himſelfe granteth that it cannot be affirmed of all the elect; but how then ſhall the truth of the Text appeare, if he confine the Text to that ſenſe? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45603:78"/> he hath miſſed the marke herein; for though it be in ſuch a ſenſe as may be w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the reaſon why all the words are in the perfect tenſe (hath) is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the two firſt (praenotion) and (praedeſtination) are acts that are paſt, and the reſt ſhall as infallibly follow as if they were paſt already; to ſome they are all paſt; to al the predeſtinated they ſhall all be; ſo that the ſenſe is this, whom he hath predeſtinated he hath or will call; whom he hath called, he hath or will glorifie, and all certaine from predeſtination. And this is but parallell to what he muſt ſay upon that Text <hi>John.</hi> 17.2. [To give eternall life to as many as thou haſt given him.] Now by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Chriſt, he ſaith page 149. is meant [bringing on men to beleeve in the heavenly call,] and ſo the ſenſe muſt be this [He hath given him power over all fleſh, to give eternall life to as many as he hath given to him, that is brought in to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the heavenly call.] Now hence I queſtion, had Chriſt received power to give eternall life to no more then were at that time brought in to beleeve? let him anſwer herein, he muſt ſalve it this way or none. (He hath) that is to whom he either hath or ſhall bring in to beleeve; ſo why not this Text? and then thus we ſhall not be affraid to affirme of all the elect they either are or ſhall be called, juſtified, glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore what he ſaith herein is a wilfull perverſion, no ſatisfaction to the text.</p>
               <p>Againe he urgeth,</p>
               <p>[This reaſon given to fortifie the propoſition, miſtaketh the end of the Apoſtles connexion of priviledges, which is not to ſet forth for how many Chriſt hath died, or ſhall receive the fruits of his death, but it is to ſet forth the priviledges of thoſe that have begun to receive the choice fruits of both his propitiation, and advocation.] True, the end and ſcope of the Apoſtle is neither of theſe, but to ſhow and make good his owne words, <hi>viz.</hi> [that all things, and ſo croſſes and afflictions ſhall worke together for the good of them that are called of his purpoſe;] yet he doth it ſo as hit he doth in it virtually ſhow who are, and how many are elected, juſtified, glorified; thoſe and ſo many are elected, as ſome to be called and glorified, thoſe and ſo many are called as are elected; thoſe and ſo many are juſtified as are elected and called; thoſe and ſo many are glorified and ſhall be, as are elected, called, and juſtified, or ſhall be; and thus they are the boundaries of one an other; and ſo, Chriſt's being given for us, being one of thoſe connected priviledges, it followeth that thoſe and only ſuch have life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and purchaſed for them, who were elected to it, and come in glorification to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is cleare that the Text doth not ſhow the priviledges of them onely who have begun actually to receive the benefits of Chriſts oblation and advocation, becauſe it ſhoweth the priviledges of all them that are predeſtinated and foreknowne; and this the Author granteth, page 115. 116. [the concatenation of theſe high favours is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the elect ſons of God;] but all that are foreknowne and are predeſtinated, do
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45603:79"/> not yet actually partake of the choice benefits of Chriſts oblation and advocation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this hitherto is perverſion, not ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Againe he giveth a third Anſwer.</p>
               <p>[This inference from theſe places deſtroyeth the diſtinction between the Goſpel and the communication of the choice benefits thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the atonement made by Chriſt, and the receit of it by his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ones.] But this without any ſhew of truth; we plead indeed for a non diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſeparation of the one from the other, and that for whom he made an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhall receive it in time; and this be might have ſeen, if envy and calumny had not blinded him, and his ſufficiently confuteth him; and this we affirme from this irrefragable chaine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. all from election to glorification are inſeparable.</p>
               <p>Againe he ſaith thus.</p>
               <p>[The connexion it ſelfe is wreſted for this inference, &amp;c. as if all Chriſt dyed for and ranſomed, muſt of neceſſity partake of all theſe priviledges; nor as if all that partake of ſome fruits of his ranſome, ſhould partake of them all; nor as if all that were called, muſt partake of them all.] But this hath as little force as any of the former words, for</p>
               <p n="1">1. The connexion is not wreſted if we finde the death of Chriſt one, of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected priviledges; for then it will appeare that he that partakes of any one, ſhall of all the reſt; elſe how are they priviledges connected? none ever yet doubted of this; now that this is one of thoſe connected priviledges, it will appeare if we ſeriouſly conſider the Chapter; we muſt know that under thoſe generals, many particulars are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: as under (vocation): he effectuall power and ſpirit of God by which we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſanctification the effects of it; under juſtification is contained the death of Chriſt the meritorious cauſe; and this is one to be included, that not only by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence but clearely expreſſed, as may appeare from the Apoſtles repetition of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, ver. 31.32.33.34. where he reaſſumeth the election, ver. 33. [Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?] Alſo juſtification, ver. 33. [It is God that juſtifieth.] He aſſumeth alſo vocation in ver. 35. (who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?) they were ſo far from being ſeparated from the love of Chriſt by them, that they are more then conquerers over them; and ſuch is a ſpirit befitting them that are called of his purpoſe, ver. 28. he reaſſumeth alſo the death of Chriſt, ver. 32.34 [He hath delivered him up for us, and [Chriſt hath died for us,] and that to make up the ſame confidence, with election, juſtification, and vocation; and what is more cleare then that the death of Chriſt is one of the connected priviledges? and then the connexion is not wreſted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſaith, [As if all that partake of ſome fruits of his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, muſt partake of all.] It is too generall to be pertinent; I know not what he may introduce under the notion of fruit of his ranſome; this is our inference, that whoever partaketh of any of thoſe connected priviledges, ſhall partake of all of them in time; elſe they are not connected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas he ſaith, [Nor as if all that were called ſhould partake of them all.] evidenceth that he doth ſteele his forehead to outface a cleare Text; doth he not ſay whom he hath called, he hath juſtified and glorified, that is, hath or will? or elſe it diſcovereth that he hath blinded his eyes ſo far as to underſtand the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45603:79"/> word (called) of outward call onely: but then where is the truth of the Text, (whom he hath called, he hath juſtified) all that are outwardly called, he neither hath nor will juſtifie nor glorifie; nay all ſhould then be juſtified and glorified, becauſe in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all the ſonnes of men are called; this will prove no propitious interpretation of the Text.</p>
               <p>But fearing that what we have ſaid ſhould prove inpregnable, he hath an other aſſault, and ſeekes to enervate it, by proving though it be one of the connected privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, yet it followeth not that becauſe every one that partaketh of thoſe priviledges had Chriſt delivered up for them, therefore every one that have Chriſt delivered up for them, partake of all the priviledges; and this he doth thus. [<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 111. 4 5. He is gracious, full of compaſſion, giveth meate to them that feare him; it will not hence follow that he giveth meat, and is compaſſionate to no other.] Which if it had not been purpoſely produced to pervert the Text more then to ſatisfie, he could not but have ſeene this example impertinent to the caſe in hand; for this in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.4.5. it is cleare, it hath not ſuch a convertible connexion as that Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. from which convertibility the force of the argument is deduced: as thoſe whom he predeſtinateth, them he calleth all, and onely thoſe, and ſo in the reſt which cannot be in the inſtance produced by him; for though he be compaſſionate to all that feare him, yet all do not feare him to whom he is compaſſionate and giveth meate; therefore that rocke is eaſily avoided, and the folly and falſehood lights upon himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But that he might illuſtrate himſelfe in the point of election, he craveth leave to thruſt out ſome of his owne conceits about the ſame, ſome whereof that are moſt momentous I ſhall examine; Having ſpoken of the election of the man Chriſt, he ſaith h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>See how preſently he taketh leave to vary from Scripture; he ſaid as he found, ſo he beleeved; what he beleeveth I know not, but I thinke that he findeth it not ſaid that Chriſt was firſt elected; this phraſe if any ſuch be, of which anon, is ſo farre from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing him to be elected firſt, that it doth not argue him elected at all; for when the Text ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> as <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe. <hi>[Christus ſecundum Apoſtolum non tantum eſt medium per quod ſalus obtinetur, ſed tanquam cauſa meritoria cujus reſpectu electio noſtra facta ſit;]</hi> That is, he is not only the meanes of ſalvation, but the meritorious cauſe of election; and I beleeve this is the Authors judgement; thus he [Chriſt is firſt elect, and ſo the roote in whom all are elected, page 115.] Now if we be elected in Chriſt as the roote, he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:45603:80"/> muſt convey election to us, as the roote doth ſap to the branches; but this is not cleare from Scripture; for if we be elected in Chriſt as the roote, then as the ſap is firſt in the roote, then in the branches, and the ſame identicall ſap which was in the roote, is conveyed to the branches; ſo muſt the ſame election wherewith Chriſt was elected, be tranſlated upon us, and ſo our election be one with Chriſts, and Chriſt his election one with ours; but neither of theſe doe I for the preſent comprehend, for that electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith we are elected, is ſuch as hath ſinners for the object of it. <hi>[Electio ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatur circa bomines ut peccatores conſideratos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>] but Chriſt was never a ſinner or ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: ſo never elected with that election that hath ſinners for the object, and as ſuch as needs pardon of ſinne, ſo that our election is not competible to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe Chriſts election in all Remonſtrants and our Author, is nothing but a deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to that office of a Mediator, and ſo to a Kingdome for the recompence of that ſervice. So our Author 118.119. but this election is not competible to us; for then ſhould we be elected mediatours; how then it ſhould be that we are elected in him as the roote, I ſee not.</p>
               <p>But happily he will ſay that his meaning is thus, Chriſt was firſt choſen to his office of a mediatour, and ſo by his mediation he merited our election, as <hi>Arminius</hi> in the forequoted place; ſo that to be [elected in him,] is not onely for Chriſt to be elected firſt, but that he alſo merited our election, and ſo, as reconciliation, ſanctification, adoption, glorification, flow from him as the head, ſo doth election alſo.</p>
               <p>To wich I will reply only thus much, this is more then any Scripture ſpeaketh, it is the generall conſent of Schoolemen and moderne Divines, that praedeſtination or election hath no cauſe in reſpect of the praedeſtinator, ſo no merit to move it. But I ſhall not trouble the Author with teſtimonies of this nature, I ſhall be content with his owne words, page 119. [All that election of Chriſt and his ſons was free from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and no cauſe but his will.] Which is altogether falſe if Chriſt merited our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; for that which is grounded on the death of Chriſt as the meritorious cauſe, cannot be grounded on Gods meere will.</p>
               <p>Againe, though <hi>Arminius</hi> would have Chriſt the meritorious cauſe of our election, yet he hath much to doe ſo to temper his pen as not to betray his cauſe and ſpeak truth at once; for let us take a ſurvey of his owne words.</p>

               <p>That is, [by whoſe blood ſalvation and life are obtained, and that as head from whom thoſe good things are derived,] and is this all for us to be elected in Chriſt? as he ſaith afterward, Chriſt to be the meritorious cauſe of grace and glory; this cometh farre ſhort of his being the meritorious cauſe of our election; all they can make out is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of beſtowing all good things that follow and flow from election; but there is a wide difference betwixt election and the good things communicated by vertue of it.</p>

               <p>To this I onely advertiſe the Author that he maimeth the Text; let him produce it intire, and ſatisfaction will be more eaſie; it is thus, [He hath elected us in him that we ſhould be holy;] now it muſt be decided whether the phraſe [in Chriſt] be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the word (elected) as if Chriſt was the meriter of election, or to (us) as if he elected none but whom he foreſaw [in Chriſt] that is beleevers, or to the words [that we ſhould be holy,] that is he elected us to obtaine holineſſe and other bleſſings (in Chriſt,) that is [for Chriſt,] and ground there is for this Query, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants take the liberty to be fluctuating in their ſentence about it, eſpecially about the two firſt acceptations, ſometimes affirming the firſt, ſometimes the ſecond, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both; the Remonſtrants in their <hi>Synod.

And <hi>Arminius</hi> putteth both together, and ſaith both are meant, which to me ſeems rather to ſtrangle the text then to interpret it; now ſeeing they doe ſo vary, it gives us occaſion to think that there may be a fourth interpretation, which may come as neare the minde of the Apoſtle as any of the former, and that is to referre the words [in Chriſt] to the laſt phraſe [that we ſhould be holy,] and ſo to ſhow, in whom, that is by and for whom we come to partake of our holineſſe and graces, as <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. perfect in Chriſt Jeſus: and if thus, his argument herefrom falleth to the ground.</p>

               <p>Beſides, were it ſo that the words were to be read thus [He hath elected us in him;] yet we may finde a more commodious interpretation then this, that Chriſt merited our election; and to be elected in Chriſt, is no more then to be deſtined to obtaine grace and glory by Chriſt, and ſo Chriſt ſhall be an eſſentiall to the definition of election; but then, his place ſhall be in the good things elected to, not the election it ſelfe.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe having mentioned Gods election of his Sonne, and his members, and his ſervants, and his decree to create the world, He thus ſaith</p>
               <p>[He decreed to do all this by and through his ſon Chriſt and for him.]</p>
               <p>Wherein he lurketh under a manifold obſcurity. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is hard to determine to what theſe words [to do all this,] are referred, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all that went went before, as election of Chriſt, of his members to ſonneſhip, and the reſt to ſervice and the creation, ſetting man in a publique place, creating a world of creatures for mans uſe; all this he had ſpoken of before; or whether only to the fourth Section and the particulars therein contained, <hi>viz</hi> creation of man and a world of creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is hard to determine whether by [for Chriſt,] he make Chriſt the finall cauſe or meritorious of all thoſe decrees; the phraſe [for Chriſt] will admit either: and I may well-query, becauſe his quoted Texts <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. clearely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the finall cauſe; but there it ſpeaketh both of God and Chriſt, making the world for him. And his expreſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> [doing all this for his ſon Chriſt,] clearely denote the meritorious cauſe, as it is taken where ever God is ſaid to do any thing for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But which way ſoever he meaneth, in either there is a manifeſt falſity; for God did not elect his Sonne, for his Sonne Chriſt, nor elect the faithfull for his Son Chriſt, he merited not either of thoſe; neither did he create the world for his Sonne Chriſt,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45603:81"/> he did not merit that; he came to ſave the loſt, we finde not that he merited that the world ſhould be made; theſe are jumbled notions that he never found in Scripture.</p>
               <p>A third particular obſervable is that he ſaith,<note place="margin">3. page 119.</note>
               </p>
               <p>[That this decree was free without any foreſight of good and evill, or reſpect had to it, but becauſe he ſo willed.].</p>
               <p>Herein I muſt advertiſe him of his remiſſe expreſſions; he ſhould have ſaid, [With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out foreſight of good or evill as the cauſe to determine his election,] elſe his Reader may well charge him with a contradiction; for in the next Section he ſaith thus. [That God foreſeeing that Adam would fall and looſe himſelfe and his, he did elect &amp;c.] Now for God to elect foreſeeing, and yet without foreſight of evill, is very ſtrange.</p>
               <p>A fourth particular is that he ſaith,<note place="margin">4. 119.</note>
               </p>
               <p>[In this praedeſtination he did praedeſtinate all his elect ſonnes to the adoption of ſonnes.] Which neither Scripture ſpeaketh nor reaſon comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for his elect ſonnes to be the object of praedeſtination; for them that are elect ſonnes, to be praedeſtinated to the adoption of ſonnes, are new found diſcoveries: It ſeemes they were firſt elected, then praedeſtinated; many have to little purpoſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth perplexed themſelves with the object of praedeſtination in their <hi>ſupra,</hi> and <hi>ſub</hi>-Lapſarian diſputes, ſome for the maſſe not made but to be made, others for the maſſe made but not fallen, a third for the maſſe made and fallen; but they may leave ſuch notions; here is a new diſcovery; the object of praedeſtination, (with our Author) is the elect, but herein he is by himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſaith,<note place="margin">5. 118.</note>
               </p>
               <p>[In that election he appointed a great number of other men to be ſervants to his Sonne Chriſt, and thoſe choſen in him.]</p>
               <p>Wherein he ſeemeth to affirme that there is an election of all to ſervice, but this without Scripture; for that there is an election of all to any thing, Scripture ſpeaketh not, nor that this deſtination to ſervice is called election; it is better ranked under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or praeterition, as he himſelfe gives the hint, page, 41. <hi>premiſ.</hi> 1. Where he hath theſe words, [In that election of ſome to ſonneſhip, and praeterition or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of others to be ſervants;] where he affirmeth that his appointment of men to be ſervants, is rather his praeterition or non election, then his election; yet here it muſt be inſerted in his diſcourſe about election; he is not very conſtant to himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He oppoſeth ſonnes and ſervants, which the Scripture owneth not; they that are ſonnes are ſervants both to Chriſt, and one to another. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p>He ſaith,<note place="margin">6. 119. 120.</note>
               </p>
               <p>[To this end he decreed to uſe ſuch meanes, &amp;c. to call both ſonnes and ſervants to acknowledge this their Lord that they might be happy.]</p>
               <p>To let ſlip many particulars I ſhall pitch but on this one, his words import that God giveth meanes to call ſuch and make ſuch happy (that is eternally,) as are deſtined onely to ſervice; but this is not conſonant to right reaſon or Scripture, upon this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For any to be Chriſts ſervants, needeth not the call of God to bring it about, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the non elect are Chriſts ſervants, but either active or paſſive, to ſerve him or he to ſerve himſelfe of them, and they to be uſed as other creatures in his worke; and this they ſhall doe whether any call or no.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:45603:82"/>
               <p>They that are deſtined to ſervice, are not deſtined to ſonſhip, or life, as appeareth by his diſtinction, or rather oppoſition, page 118. Nay it appeareth that ſuch in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſonſhip and eternall life are paſſed by, page 41. That is he hath decreed not to bring in ſuch to the inheritance. Nay further that ſuch [being the reſidue of men not elected to ſonſhip,] are from eternity decreed to obduration, and to be given up, and that he will not overpower them, as he doth his elect; yet ſuch in his divinty God decreed in time to call that they might be happy: He bluſheth not to affirme this of God; but as well may he tell us, that when God hath decreed the world ſhall not ſee light, he ſhall create the Sunne to enlighten it; but of this more preſently.</p>
               <p>Making cleare the buſineſſe of election, he thus ſaith,</p>
               <p>[God decreed to overcome his elect, freely forgiving diſobedience, by his Spirit making them willing, bringing them in to beleeve. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to harden the reſidue, and give them up for contempt of means.] Wherein ſome particulars are obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Speaking of the firſt, he giveth the name of elect as well he may, becauſe that decree to overcome and bring them in to beleeve, conſtituteth them the elect both to grace and glory; but when he ſpeaketh of the other ſort, he giveth them onely the name of [the reſidue,] as if his decree to harden did not bring them under the notion of reprobation, as well as the decree to overcome did bring the other under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of election; wherein he is either miſerably blind, or wilfully diſſembles, when he profeſſeth that he is ſuch a ſtranger to reprobation in Scripture. Seeing now he is able to ſee from Scripture that God from eternity did decree to harden moſt men, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is nothing elſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſtrange that the Author treating of election, ſhould produce this decree in God to harden moſt men from eternity; is this a particular of election? then repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate men, deſperate devils may be ſaid to be elected: certainely the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e expreſſions had been better reſerved till he had treated of reprobation, as he doth afterwards.</p>
               <p>But herein a piece of his egregious diſſimulation is ſeen, in that this which is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, is here ſhufled in to paſſe untaken notice of in the buſineſſe of election; that ſo when he cometh to ſpeake of reprobation, he may ſay, (as he doth,) that the Scripture ſcarce owneth a reprobation but an actuall, done in time; when he had inſerted theſe words in their proper place, he might have ſeen that there is a reprobation from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

               <p>But this is hardly a ſober ſolution to that ſober argument; for if the Author had been as ſober as the objector, he might have ſeene that in denying his ranſome for all, he denyeth his death for all, becauſe his ranſome is by dying, and whom he ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed he died for; and ſo for whom he died not, he did not ranſome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he ſaid no more, the concluſion oppoſeth the authors doctrine ſtrongly, which in every leafe is for univerſall ranſome and mediation, as appeareth by his after words.</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:45603:87"/>
               <p>[He could not be Lord of all nor challenge ſubmiſſion, &amp;c. if he had not ranſomed them.]</p>
               <p>The emptineſſe of which hath been often diſcovered; his being Lord of all, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging ſubmiſſion, does no way inferre a a ranſome; the Father is and doth all thoſe things mentioned, yet he never ranſomed them, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> died for them; the Father was Lord, and challenged ſubmiſſion of man in innocency, when no need of ranſome; and ſo for all the reſt I have ſhowne that they doe not neceſſarily infer a ranſome.</p>
               <p>But he afterwards ſaith,</p>
               <p>[The anſwer to that objection is eaſie.]</p>
               <p>But what need an anſwer if the objection be ſo ſober as not to oppoſe him? and eaſie it is to give an anſwer; but to give ſuch an one as ſatisfieth, that is not ſo eaſie; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by his whole diſcourſe; but let us ſee his facile and obvious anſwers; it is this.</p>
               <p>[As the mediation of Chriſt is both more generally and more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; the firſt as he is Mediatour between God and man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. the ſecond as he is Mediatour of the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. ſo in all his offices there is that which is more generall, and that which is more ſpeciall.]</p>
               <p>Now this labours with a double error; for neither is his mediation twofold, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are his offices twofold, that is generall and ſpeciall; as for the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt his mediation of the New Teſtament, and his mediation betweene God and man, is ridiculous and not conſonant to Scripture; for, when he was ſaid to be a mediatour betwixt God and man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 5. was he not in that mediation a mediatour of the New Teſtament? is there any mediation that is not by a New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, even for tranſgreſſors that were under the former Teſtament? as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. and was not his mediation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. a mediation between God man? is there any mediation that is not between God and man? was not that mediation in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.15. for the redemption of tranſgreſſors, and by death? and was not that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. the like? and is there any mediation for tranſgreſſors, and by death, but ſuch as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man? no marvell if ſuch anſwers be eaſie and ready at hand.</p>
               <p>Againe he urgeth thus,</p>
               <p>[as a Prieſt he offered ſacrifice in reſpect of one end, <hi>(viz.)</hi> propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. &amp; 2.9. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.29. 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.2. but in reſpect of all ends, propitiation, ſealing the New Teſtament, teſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, and for the uttermoſt end in all, for his called and choſen ones, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.15.]</p>
               <p>As for his diſtinction of ends, dividing ſome to all, others for his choſen, is without ground, as I have ſhowen in the former part of my treatiſe; and cleare it is, becauſe his propitiation is nowhere ſaid to be for every man, therefore all the ends of his death are for the ſame perſons. Yea that Text <hi>Heb,</hi> 9.14.15. hinteth of no other end but propitiation or redemption of tranſgreſſions as ver. 15. yet the Author himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that it is for his called and choſen ones, and that thoſe Texts <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>John,</hi> 29. 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.2. doe not hold ſuch a generall popitiation, I have ſhowen at large; this is but <hi>[petitio principij.]</hi> And why he ſhould produce a double oblation from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.15. I ſee not, ſeeing he cannot produce any differing circumſtance; both by Chriſt, both by death, both for tranſgreſſions, both that thoſe that are called
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:45603:88"/> might receive the promiſe; now if he ſhall ſay the one is for all, the other for his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, this is not againſt us, but giveth us the queſtion, and granteth that the all in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. is no more then the choſen ones in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.15. Hereby we may have a taſte, that let the argument be as weak as it can, yet his anſwers are as weake and come farre ſhort of diſcovering any weakeneſſe in it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the ſeventh Objection.</head>
               <p>A ſeventh argument produced by him is this.</p>
               <p>[If God intended life for all men by Chriſt death, he would certainely have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome meanes to bring all men to the knowledge of Chriſt, and ſo to repentance and faith.</p>
               <p>But to many he giveth no meanes at all; to others denied meanes when his ſervants would have carried the ſame. Therefore.]</p>
               <p>This argument was the fifth argument in the conference, and in its right formation runneth thus.</p>
               <p>[If Chriſt have procured reconciliation and remiſſion by his death for every man, none excepted, then the word of reconciliation would and ſhould have been preached to every man, none excepted.]</p>
               <p>But the word of reconciliation is not &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt did not procure remiſſion for all and every man.]</p>
               <p>But to take his argument as it runneth, I ſhall firſt ſhow the force of the argument; it is but conſonant to the wiſdome of God, to have made ſuch a purchaſe by his Sonne, or Chriſt by himſelfe at ſo deare a rate as his blood, and that for the good of men, that he ſhould make a diſcovery of this, that ſo men might come to partake of it and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of it; for no man can partake of this remiſſion but by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and faith is not ordinarily begotten but by the word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. hence the Apoſtle putteth both together, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15.18.19. with dying and reconciling, he committed the Goſpel of reconciliation to the Apoſtles; but that many millions die without any knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, Scripture ſhoweth and experience witneſſeth. Now to perpend his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; hereto he ſaith.</p>
               <p>[This objection denyeth neither the death or ranſome of Chriſt to be for all men, but onely any intendment of life and ſaving grace thereby.]</p>
               <p>And doth this cleare him from the force of this argument? he is ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded hereby; becauſe he holdeth that his purchaſe, and ranſome, and death, was with an intendment of life to every man, as he ſaith, page 15. [He hath wrought for all men that they might be eternally ſaved;] doth not this ſufficiently diſcover the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Author in anſwering the objection with that which confirmeth it and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth himſelfe? He further ſaith.</p>
               <p>[Nor for any but where the Goſpel is not granted.]</p>
               <p>And enough too; becauſe if Chriſt died not for all thoſe where the Goſpel never commeth, he died not for every man without exception. Yet he can manfully ſay the force of the objection is weake, and his grounds follow.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:45603:88"/>
               <p>[The Scripture hath expreſſely affirmed Gods intention to be that they all might be ſaved, and repent, and beleeve, and be further ſaved. <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.4.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.]</p>
               <p>But what doth this helpe him? certainely nothing; becauſe that to deny Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of life to all, was nothing againſt him, as even now he profeſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he meane every ſonne of Adam, no place cited by him cleareth it; it is not ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to reaſon, that God ſhould intend thoſe men might or ſhould beleeve and be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaved, whom he decreed from eternity ſhould be damned: this I have at large provd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Author ſo confidently can ſay, that it is Gods intention that all men ſhould beleeve, he need not be ſo ſqueemiſh at the affirming that it is his intention that all men ſhould be eternally ſaved, which I finde him ſometimes and others of his opinion ſo loth to affirme. But he further ſaith.</p>
               <p>[If we cannot in the workes of God ſee the fulfilling of the ſayings of God, it becomes us to admire his wiſdome and holineſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile our ignorance, &amp;c. and not by raſh judging deny the truth of his words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.]</p>
               <p>True, if we be ſure ſuch a thing is the worke of God, if we cannot fathome it, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wiſdome of God is good, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. but we may admire our owne folly and bewaile it, to put ſuch a ſenſe on Scripture, as that we cannot make it and the wiſdome of God to meete; we deny not the truth of Gods words but the Authors gloſſe; and if he can prove it to be truly the worke of God, or that it is a truth, I ſhall admire, though I cannot fathom it. Hitherto I conceive he hath been oppugning the major; afterwards he cometh to the minor, and thus ſaith.</p>
               <p>[The Scripture teſtifieth that God hath and doth uſe ſome meanes towards all men, not onely in his workes of creation and providence, which giveth ſome teſtimony of his goodneſſe, &amp;c. but with ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light, yea it may be ſome rumour of the Goſpel, as much as drew <hi>Rahab</hi> to beleeve, &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>Hereby attempting to prove, that ſome diſcovery of the purchaſe is made knowne to every man. But very confidently he ſaith God affordeth ſome meanes to all men, but ſhowes not to what end, whether to manifeſt his power and Godhead, and meer good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; or further to ſhow his mercy in our repairing; but this latter is moſt ſuiteable to his purpoſe and the argument; but what meanes doth he uſe? he ſaith, [not onely by his workes of creation and providence,] to intimate that thoſe are meanes to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſomething of Chriſt; but without ground; for the creation can no more alone diſcover a Saviour, then they could in the creature; goodneſſe we may ſee in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not mercy: indeed if we have a word with them, it can tell us we have ſinned and ſo forfeited all, then we may ſee mercy, not elſe, and all that the creation diſcovers is power and Godhead; but this there was before any mercy, and may be without it; but he ſaith, [With further light,] but ſpeaketh not what that is, therefore I cannot anſwer; but he addeth, [It may be ſome rumour of the Goſpel,] but no Scripture ſaith it; if it doe, why doth he darken truth with [May be?] if it doe not, why doth he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne truth with (may be?) he muſt not thinke to overthrow arguments with [May be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe ſaith thus, <hi>Cauſa cur deus omnibus Chriſtum non revelet eſt quod parentes repudiaverunt,</hi>] (that is) the cauſe why God doth not reveale Chriſt to all, is, becauſe their parents have rejected: if he give a reaſon, then certainely that muſt be a truth of which he giveth a reaſon, that Chriſt is not revealed to all; and the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants confeſſe, <hi>[Ecce populos quoſdam etiam hujus temporis qui adhucdum nihil de hoc recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliationis verbo ſciunt;</hi>] (that is) there is a people in this time, that never heard a word of that worke of reconciliation; and in this thing they miſerably falter; ſometimes they ſay, [As much as in him lieth he diſpenſeth it;] ſometimes [for his part he is ready to take care that it be preached;] ſometimes [he commandeth it to be preached;] ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times [it ought to be preached;] ſometimes [it may be preached;] and if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, would ſay many more to ſalve it. And therefore though we will not ſay that God doth not uſe any meanes to know him and his Godhead, yet we may ſay, he uſeth no meanes to every man to diſcover Chriſt and the redemption by him. He further ſaith.</p>
               <p>[Gods denyall of his ſervants to preach in ſome places for a time, as in <hi>Acts,</hi> 16.6, 7. proveth not an utter deniall of all meanes to them (and among many reaſons he giveth this one, but he may deny it for one time, yet grant it for an other.]</p>
               <p>All this may be received, yet we not hurt; for we ſay not that he denyeth them all meanes to know him, but meanes to know Chriſt he did; and what though he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Goſpel afterwards to thoſe places, yet in the intervall of time did not many (thinketh he,) die without knowledge of Chriſt? as for example, many Gentiles pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in ignorance of Chriſt, during the time of the Goſpels confinement to the Jews, though afterward it was granted to the Gentiles: and if ſo, our Minor is yet firme; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of moment doth he elſe produce but what confirmeth that aſſumption that he would overthrow.</p>
               <p>Thus have I martialed up our arguments in their native force, and his anſwers in their greateſt ſtrength; and herein have been as faithfull as I am able; and whether he hath abated the force of any one argument, or given any thing but cavills to darken the truth, I leave to any indifferent reader to judge; and what faithfulneſſe he hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in laying downe our arguments, I leave alſo to judge; in the next Chapter wee ſhall ſee if he have any more dexterity in producing his owne arguments, then he hath manifeſted in reciting ours.</p>

                  </gap>, that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by grace through faith is the gift of God, as <hi>Rom</hi> 6.33. the gift of God is eternall life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. But to take it as as he propoundeth it, and from this that faith is the gift of God which is a truth, hence the doubt is this. Seeing faith is the gift of God, and he hath determined not to give to every man that faith; therefore it is not probable that Chriſt would lay downe his life for them, upon the condition of faith, whom he ſeeth cannot beleeve without God, and to them God will not give it; to the ſalving of which he ſpeakes many things; but little to ſatisfaction, he ſeemeth to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſalvation, without man in Chriſt, for men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſalvation in men inabling men to beleeve.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A ſalvation upon men both in ſoul and body compleat in heaven. Now he ſaith that this phraſe, [Yee are ſaved by grace through faith,] in <hi>Eph.</hi> 28. is meant of the ſecond ſalvation; but firſt that is not cleare; for then the ſenſe muſt be this, yee are brought in to beleeve through faith: ſo that faith is by him the meanes conducing to faith; this is abſurd; I thinke it plainely appeares to be meant of compleat ſalvation in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45603:90"/> heaven, and it ſaith ye are ſaved, becauſe they were certainely to be ſaved through faith. But be it ſo as he ſaith; yet the doubt is where it was; yet that being ſaved by faith is the gift of God, and he not giving that grace to all, he would not give his Son to merit life for all upon the condition of beleeving; if I can in his next be informed of his ſtrength in his expreſſes to this purpoſe, I ſhall ſay more.</p>

               <p>[<hi>Iohn,</hi> 6.37. All that my Father giveth me ſhall come unto me, and him that cometh I will not caſt out.]</p>
               <p>Now from this Text here lieth the doubt; it is not conſonant to reaſon or Scripture, that Chriſt would lay downe his blood to purchaſe life for them whom his Father had not given to him; ſeeing his Fathers giving is the meaſure of coming to him, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the compaſſe of the benefit of his impetration, his will being one with his Fathers, his impetration would be equall with his Fathers giving to him; this he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to remove, by ſhowing a fouretold giving of men to Chriſt.</p>

               <p>But what neede ſo many words to darken a cleare Text? and what need ſo many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations, when it is cleare that all of them cannot be the ſenſe of this place, or give any light to it? The ſecond giving cannot be meant, becauſe all for whom he undertook and ranſomed, in the Authors judgement, doe not come to him, that is beleeve on him, ſo contrary to the text, all that my Father giveth me ſhall come to me.</p>
               <p>Neither can the third be the ſenſe here meant, upon the ſame ground; many who are Chriſts at his diſpoſe, ſo as to be their Lord, they yet come not to him, that is beleeve on him; and thoſe that by his judiciary power come to be judged, or come to ſue for mercy, many of them are caſt out: as is ſeeme in the wedding, and the five fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; therefore little need be ſaid of theſe, becauſe they doe not expound the Text by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of theſe; all the conteſtation betwixt the Remonſtrants and their adverſaries, and me and my Antagoniſt, is betwixt the firſt and the fourth; he affirmeth the fourth to be the genuine ſenſe of this place; but againſt not onely reaſon but common ſenſe; for by comming to Chriſt is certainely meant beleeving in him, comming by faith as is cleare by many Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. [come unto me yee that are heavy laden,] that is beleeve in me, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 6.64.65. compare them together, [yee beleeve not, no man can come unto me except my Father draw him, and ver. 35. both are put together, [He that beleeveth ſhall not hunger, he that cometh ſhall not thirſt;] ſo according to him the ſenſe muſt be this, they that have come ſhall come, or they that have beleeved ſhall beleeve; but this is very improbable; the gloſſe of the Remonſtrants ſolveth it not,<note place="margin">Act.

                  <hi>[ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet]</hi> for <hi>[venite debet]</hi> that is [ſhall come] by it is meant [ought to come] for it is ſtill under the ſame abſurdity to ſay they that have come ought to come, as to ſay they ſhall come.</p>
               <p>The next thing is to conſider whether the firſt interpretation be the right or no; it ſeemeth to be the right, becauſe the giving is antecedaneous to comming or beleeving, therefore moſt probable to be the giving by election; now of this ſenſe he ſaith.</p>
               <p>[So they may be [though not in Scripture] truly ſaid to be given him.]</p>
               <p>But whence doth he deduce this liberty, to ſay that it is truly ſaid of Chriſt which is not ſaid in Scripture? it ſeemes the Scripture is not the adequate ſubject of truth.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:45603:91"/>
               <p>[But theſe are not the onely number that are given to him; for as they are given to him to be heires with him, ſo were all the reſt given to him to ſerve him and his people.]</p>
               <p>Which is very impertinent to the caſe in hand; for we queſtion not whether none be any way given to Chriſt, but ſuch as are given by election: but whether in this Text the giving by election is meant or no; let all be given to Chriſt to be his ſervants, yet here thoſe that come to him are given to him to be heires with him; and this giving is before coming, therefore by election. Againe,</p>
               <p>[Where election is ſet forth under this tearme of giving to Chriſt, is hard to finde in Scripture.]</p>

And then he groundleſly concludes</p>
               <p>[In this place it neither is nor can be ſo taken.]</p>
               <p>But we have no reaſon nor Scripture to prove, but his bare word only to affirme it, but it is not of weight to carry it. 2. If it be not a giving by election, and yet antecedaneous to beleeving, I hope he will in his next make it appeare what it is; and thus notwithſtanding his groundleſſe evaſion, the doubt is ſtill unſatisfied, from that Text <hi>John,</hi> 6.37. The third Text produced is, <hi>Acts,</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life beleeved;</hi>] the doubt hence is this, that ſeeing the reaſon why men beleeved, was becauſe they were ordained to eternall life, and ſo the number of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and the ordained to life are equall and run in an equipage, it is not probable that Chriſt would ſhed his blood for thoſe to procure life upon faith whom he knew were not ordained to eternal life, This he would remove thus.</p>
               <p>[The words ordained to eternall life [it is to be feared] are miſtaken, as if they ſignified only the prime election to ſonſhip, whereas it is not found where that only ſenſe is ſet forth in the words (ordained to life).]</p>
               <p>The cleareſt truth may be eclipſed by the interpoſition of humane gloſſes and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions; but to any unprejudiced man theſe three things may appeare.</p>

That it was God that did ordaine them, for ſo of his act it ſpeakes, ver. 47. and of ſetting <hi>Paul</hi> to be for ſalvation, he did alſo ordaine them to life that were to beleeve; indeed the Remonſtrants are pleaſed to ſay,<note place="margin">Act.

               <p n="2">2. We may ſee it is an appointment to eternall life, and that in plain terms; ſo that it muſt be an ordaining to ſonſhip and inheritance.</p>
